If you have read through the [Prerequisites](/installation/Prerequisites) you should have selected [a pre-compiled Tasmota firmware binary](/installation/Prerequisites#tasmota-firmware-binary) or chosen to [compile your own Tasmota firmware binary](#compiling-from-source).

Once you have followed [Hardware preparation](/installation/Hardware-Preparation), your device should be in Flash Mode and ready for a Tasmota firmware binary file to be flashed. For that you need a **flashing tool**.

Optionally, you may want to back up the device manufacturer's firmware on the 1 in a million chance you don't like Tasmota.

## Tasmotizer!
Tasmotizer! is specifically designed for use with Tasmota with an easy to use GUI and [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) under the hood.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer/releases) for your platform. If using Windows just double click the downloaded file and it'll start, no installation required. For python follow the installation [instructions](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer#installation-and-how-to-run).

> [!NOTE] If you get an anti-virus infection warning don't fret, it is a [known false positive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777106/program-made-with-pyinstaller-now-seen-as-a-trojan-horse-by-avg). If you're still apprehensive you can always run the Python version. 

**It is time to Tasmotize!**

![Tasmotizer UI](../_media/tasmotizer1.png ":no-zoom")

1. Connect your device to the serial-to-USB adapter or plug in NodeMCU/D1 mini.
1. Check whether the correct **serial port** (COM or tty port) is selected. Tasmotizer! will try its best to select the right one for you.
1. Choose Tasmota firmware binary:
   * **BIN file** - browse to the Tasmota firmware binary you downloaded or compiled.
   * **Release** - select from a list of available release binaries
   * **Development** - select from a list of latest development binaries
4. _optional_ Backup the original device firmware
5. Erase flash
> [!DANGER] Leave *Erase before flashing* checked if it is the first time flashing Tasmota on the device or you're experiencing issues with the existing flash and need to do a full erase. If you're upgrading an already flashed Tasmota and wish to keep your settings, uncheck *Erase before flashing*.

6. Click **Tasmotize** and wait until done.

![Tasmotizer progress](../_media/tasmotizer2.png ":no-zoom")

If the flash was successful it will display: 

![Tasmotizer success](../_media/tasmotizer3.png ":no-zoom")

Unplug your serial programming adapter or device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. Your device is now ready for [Initial configuration](/installation/Initial-Configuration). 

> [!TIP]
>You can use **Send Config** Tasmotizer! button for the initial configuration of your device.

<!-- ## Tasmota PyFlasher
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tasmota/tasmota-pyflasher/v1/images/splash.png" style="margin:5px;float:left;width:150px"></img>
Tasmota PyFlasher is specifically designed for use with Tasmota binaries with an easy to use GUI. It is based on [NodeMcu Pyflasher](https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher) and [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmota-pyflasher/releases) for your platform (currently only Windows). Double click the downloaded file and it'll start, no installation required. Simple and fast...

![Tasmota PyFlasher UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/68957676-d2399a00-07ca-11ea-9a21-3ef2fb7d4349.png)

1. Connect your device to the serial-to-USB adapter or plug in NodeMCU/D1 mini.
2. Select the correct **Serial port** (COM# port). Leave on auto-select if not sure.
3. **Browse** to the Tasmota firmware binary you downloaded or compiled.

> [!DANGER] Leave *Erase flash* on *yes, wipe all data!!!* if it is the first time flashing Tasmota on the device or you're experiencing issues with the existing flash and need to do a full erase. If you're upgrading an already flashed Tasmota and wish to keep your settings, set it to *no*.

4. Click **Flash Tasmota** and wait until done.

If the flash was successful the _Console_ window will display: 

![Flash succeeded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/55690010-489c3100-598c-11e9-8135-e44469037e11.png)

Unplug your serial programming adapter or device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. Your device is now ready for [Initial configuration](/installation/Initial-Configuration).  -->

## esptool.py

Esptool is the official Espressif tool for flashing ESP8266 chips. It requires Python, if you do not have an installed copy of Python 2.x or 3.x download and install it from https://www.python.org.

Download the [esptool Source code](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases) to a folder of your choice.
Go to the folder and install Esptool with command 
```
python setup.py install
```

#### Upload Tasmota
Make sure you followed the steps to put your device in flash mode. Place your chosen firmware binary file in the same folder as esptool.py.

Esptool uses the serial interface to communicate with your device. On Windows these interfaces are named COM1, COM2, etc. and on Linux they are named /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc. Before using esptool, make sure you know which serial port your programming adapter is connected to.

The following use `COM5` as an example. Change `COM5` with your serial port designation.

Ensure the device is in flash mode before each step.

#### Backup Firmware <small>(optional step)</small>
Backup the current firmware with the following command:
```
esptool.py --port COM5 read_flash 0x00000 0x100000 fwbackup.bin
```
*When the command completes the device is not in flash mode anymore.* Repeat the process of putting your device in programming mode.

#### Erase Flash Memory
Erase the complete flash memory holding the firmware with the following command:
```
esptool.py --port COM5 erase_flash
```
It only takes a few seconds to erase 1M of flash.

*When the command completes the device is not in flash mode anymore.* Repeat the process of putting your device in programming mode.

#### Upload Firmware
Load the chosen Tasmota firmware file with the following command (e.g., `tasmota.bin` in this example):

```
esptool.py --port COM5 write_flash -fs 1MB -fm dout 0x0 tasmota.bin
```

Unplug your serial programming adapter or your device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. Your device is now ready for [Initial configuration](/installation/Initial-Configuration). 

> [!TIP]
>For proper device initialization after the firmware upload completes, power down and power up the device.

## Esptool Executable
The executable version of esptool is maintained by Ivan Grokhotkov and releases are kept at [https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases). Supports Linux, Linux ARM, Windows 32-bit and Mac

#### First Step
For the purpose of simplicity only the Windows version will be explained here, but the commands and parameters are the same for Windows, Linux and Mac.

Download the latest release of [Esptool-CK](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases) and extract the compressed file to a folder of your choice.

Place your chosen firmware binary file (e.g., `tasmota.bin` in the example below) in the same folder as Esptool-CK to simplify the process.

The following commands use `COM5` as an example. Change `COM5` with your port designation.

Ensure the device is in flash mode before each step.

#### Erase Flash Memory  
```
esptool -cp COM5 -ce -v
```

#### Upload firmware
Once the erase is complete, put device back into programming mode and upload the firmware
```
esptool -cp COM5 -bm dout -cf tasmota.bin -v
```

Unplug your serial programming adapter or your device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. Your device is now ready for [Initial configuration](/installation/Initial-Configuration). **For proper device initialization after the firmware upload completes, power down and power up the device.**
