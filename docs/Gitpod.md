Even though Tasmota offers several pre-compiled firmware variants, sometimes the ready-to-flash binaries aren't enough.
If you need to enable or disable some features, or simply change some parameters, then you need to compile a firmware binary yourself.  

If you are not experienced enough or don't want to install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like PlatformIO or ATOM on your computer, compiling your own firmware is a breeze using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Gitpod is a web browser based online IDE. All you need to use it is to link your GitHub account (or make a new one [here](https://github.com/join?source=header)). Gitpod will take care of all the necessary software package dependencies for you.

After you successfully sign in, you can start your personal project. The fastest way to load Tasmota into Gitpod is with one of the following links:  

- Development Branch: [`https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/development`](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/development)
- Master Release: [`https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/master`](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/master)
- [TasmoCompiler](https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler/blob/master/README.md): [`https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler`](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler)

**Browser Extension**  
Gitpod has a browser extension (Chrome and Firefox) which is handy to directly load a GitHub project into your personal Gitpod work-space.

## Using Gitpod
After Gitpod loads the project, you will be greeted by the main window. Gitpod will then automatically compile `tasmota.bin`. Wait for the compilation to complete.

The display consists of three panels:  

1. Explorer
2. Editor
3. Terminal

### Customize Firmware Features and Settings

!!! warning
    The proper method of customizing firmware compilation options is to use the `user_config_override.h` file. You should not change the `my_user_config.h` file. 
    
To modify the stock configuration:  

1. Select the `/tasmota` folder in the Explorer (1) pane
2. Create a new file called `user_config_override.h`
3. In the Editor (2) pane, add, change, or remove anything you need in your configuration file to define your own settings. Refer to the `user_config_override_sample.h` file as well as `my_user_config.h` for `#define` options ([sample](https://pastebin.com/M5KPPWAJ)). You can find a list of Tasmota features and settings listed [here](Firmware-Builds). Define the features you require in your configuration file.
4. Click 'File' on the menu bar and 'Save' your edits.

### Prepare the IDE for Compilation

1. Open the `platformio.ini` file located in the `/tasmota` root directory (scroll to the bottom of the file Explorer (1) pane). In this file, removing a leading semicolon `;` enables a statement.
2. In the Editor (2) pane:
   - If you are using your own `user_config_override.h`, you must tell the compiler to use it. Rename `platformio_override_sample.ini` to `platformio_override.ini`.
   - Default Tasmota Arduino Core will be compiled. If you wish to use a different Core, find the `[core_active]` section in the file and enable the `platform` and `build_flags` lines for the desired Core. Then click 'File' on the menu bar and 'Save' your edits.

### Compile Your Firmware
This action is done in the Terminal pane (3) with simple commands.  

<!-- ![compile command](https://i.imgur.com/wXA4hvd.png) -->

The simplest one is `platformio run -e tasmota`. With this command, Gitpod will compile the Tasmota firmware with the features you selected. If you need a different variant, you can specify this option on the command line:  
`platformio run -e <variant-name>`  

Examples:  

- `platformio run -e tasmota-sensors`  
- `platformio run -e tasmota-DE`

Compilation normally takes only a couple of minutes. The time it takes is directly related to how many variants you build. When done, you will find the firmware file in the folder `/Tasmota/build_output/firmware/<variant-name>.bin` in the Explorer (1) pane.

Download `<variant-name>.bin` to your computer by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Download'. You are now ready to flash your device.

### Flash Your Device
#### OTA Flash
If you already have Tasmota flashed on your device, you can use the `File Upload` OTA method to load the new firmware binary file.

1. Download [`tasmota-minimal.bin`](http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/tasmota-minimal.bin)
2. Make a backup of the device configuration using the web UI `Configuration` menu option.
3. Upload `tasmota-minimal.bin` to your device using the web UI `Firmware Upgrade` selection. Choose `Upgrade by file upload`.
3. After `tasmota-minimal.bin` is successfully loaded, select `Firmware Upgrade` once again and upload the firmware file compiled using Gitpod.

#### Serial Flash
Follow the same [procedure for flashing](installation/Flashing) as you would any new device.
