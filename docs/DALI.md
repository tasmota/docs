??? note "This feature is included in tasmota32 binaries"     

    When [compiling your build](Compile-your-build) add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
    ```arduino
    #ifndef USE_DALI
    #define USE_DALI        // Add support for DALI gateway (+5k code)
    #endif
    ```

## What is DALI?

[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Addressable_Lighting_Interface) (DALI) is a trademark for network-based products that control lighting.

A DALI network consists of at least one application controller and bus power supply (which may be built into any of the products) as well as input devices (e.g. sensors and push-buttons), control gear (e.g., electrical ballasts, LED drivers and dimmers) with DALI interfaces.

Application controllers can control, configure or query each device by means of a bi-directional data exchange. Unlike DMX, multiple controllers can co-exist on the bus.

The DALI protocol permits addressing devices individually, in groups or via broadcast.

Scenes can be stored in the devices, for recall on an individual, group or broadcast basis. Groups and scenes are used to ensure simultaneous execution of level changes, since each packet requires about 25 ms - or 1.5 seconds if all 64 addresses were to change level.

## Implemented Features

Tasmota DALI gateway is an application controller. It defaults to supporting Device Type 6 (DT6) or Part207 single color LED lighting controller using standard Tasmota light controls.

## Hardware

The driver is supported on both ESP8266 and ESP32. A possible DALI interface could look like this as used on the DALI 2 Click. <img alt="Dali" src="../_media/dali_schematics.png"></img> On the left side is the connection, TB1, to the DALI bus which should provide a voltage between 16V to 22.5V DC. On the right side is the connection to an ESP device where wires are connected according to the table:

| DALI interface | ESP device |
|----------------|------------|
|            VCC | 3V3        |
|        DALI_TX | DALI TX_i  |
|        DALI_RX | DALI RX_i  |
|            GND | GND        |

### MikroE DALI Click

Initial implementation has been performed using [DALI Click](https://www.mikroe.com/dali-click) with GPIO settings `DALI TX` and `DALI RX` and a [Busch-Jaeger Rotary dimmer](https://www.busch-jaeger.de/en/online-catalogue/detail/2CKA006599A2986) acting as a DALI bus power supply.

### MikroE DALI 2 Click

A redesigned version called [DALI 2 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/dali-2-click) also works fine whith GPIO settings `DALI TX_i` and `DALI RX_i`.

### Shelly DALI Dimmer Gen3

<img alt="ShellyDali" src="../_media/dali_tasmota_main.png" style="margin:10px;float:right;width:20em"> </img>
The ESP32-C3 based [Shelly DALI Dimmer Gen3](https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-dali-dimmer-gen3) is supported using template 
```
{"NAME":"Shelly DALI Dimmer Gen3","GPIO":[34,4736,0,3840,11360,11392,128,129,0,1,576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
```
and additional commands 
```
Backlog AdcGpio1 10000,10000,4000; ButtonTopic 0; SetOption1 1; SetOption11 0; SetOption32 20; DimmerStep 5; LedTable 0
```
The following rule
```
rule1 on button1#state=2 do dimmer + endon on button2#state=2 do dimmer - endon on button1#state=3 do power 2 endon on button2#state=3 do power 2 endon
```
allows dimmer control using two buttons.

Notice that the Shelly DALI dimmer uses inverted DALI GPIO's `DALI TX_i` and `DALI_RX_i` and provides a limited DALI bus power supply of 10mA, enough for 5 DALI control gear.

To add Shelly DALI Dimmer to a bus powered environment it's best to disable the internal Shelly power supply. In that case use template (changed GPIO3)
```
{"NAME":"Shelly DALI Dimmer Gen3 (No power)","GPIO":[34,4736,0,3872,11360,11392,128,129,0,1,576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
``` 
In addition you can easily remove the Shelly power supply assembly from the main board.
