# PCA9557 GPIO Expander

Technical Data from the manufacturer:
* NXP [PCA9557](https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ic-spi-i3c-interface-devices/general-purpose-i-o-gpio/8-bit-ic-bus-and-smbus-i-o-port-with-reset:PCA9557)

The PCA9557 has 8 IO pins which the PCA9557 driver uses as D0 - D7. This is visualized in the circuit diagram below.

You will need to pick an I2C address using the address mapping according to pin A0, A1, and A2 as from the datasheet as follows:

### Supporting modes

Starting with Tasmota v12.5.0.x several and mixed PCA9557 are supported, adding switches, buttons and relays acted on as if they were directly connected to the ESP8266 or ESP32 configured using a JSON file containing a template describing the GPIO's as used on the basic Tasmota device.

To enable it you will only need to add in `user_config_override.h` 

`#define USE_PCA9557`

This enables the driver which in turn at restart will search for the JSON file in three possible locations:

* if a filesystem is present it looks for file `pca9557.dat`
* if not found and rules are supported it looks for a specific rule entry like `on file#pca9557.dat do <template> endon`
* if not found and scripts are supported it looks for a specific script like `-y <template>`

If no JSON file is found the driver does not claim any PCA9557 device.

A typical JSON template would look like `{"NAME":"PCA9557 expander","BASE":0,"GPIO":[224,225,226,227,32,33,34,35]}` which adds four relays and four buttons.

The template consists of a `"NAME"` data pair with any description of the template, an optional `"BASE"` data pair selecting if either relative (0 = default) or absolute (1) button and/or switch numbering is used and a `"GPIO"` data pair with numbers representing the functions of the GPIO's in order from lowest I2C address IO0 to highest I2C address IO7 and are based on the numbers known from the base tasmota template used on the ESP8266 or ESP32.

The following list contains the current supported functions:

Function||Code|Description
-|-|-|-
None||0|Not used
Button_n1..32|Bn|64..95|Button to Gnd (needs external resistor)
Button_in1..32|Bin|128..159|Button inverted to Vcc (needs external resistor)
Switch_n1..28|Sn|192..219|Switch to Gnd (needs external resistor)
Relay1..32|R|224..255|Relay
Relay_i1..32|Ri|256..287|Relay inverted
Output_Hi|Oh|3840|Fixed output high
Output_lo|Ol|3872|Fixed output low

```

Since the PCA9557 has no interrupt pin, buttons and switches will be polled every 50ms.

You will need to define the address you are using in `user_config_override.h` for the driver to know on which address the PCA9557 is expected to be found.

`#define USE_PCA9557_ADDR 0x18`

The PCA9557 chips allow for both INPUT and OUTPUT.

If OUTPUT is enabled, telemetry data for the current state of OUTPUT pins will also be provided by telemetry.

### Usage of the driver

The PCA9557 chip (or breakout board) must be connected to the ESP8266/ESP32 and the I2C pins must be configured for the module similar to the following:

![Tasmota Generic_Config_Menu](https://github.com/cctweaker/misc/blob/0c852e4ead41cbb4ea115b975cae365519a478c7/PCA9557/Generic_Config_Menu.png)

Once that is complete you may want to confirm that the Tasmota firmware is finding your PCA9557 chip by sending the command through serial or MQTT:  
`I2Cscan`

You should see a response giving you an address within the range of the PCA9557 chip (0x18 through 0x1F) which may look as follows  
`MQT: stat/tasmota/RESULT = {"I2CScan":"Device(s) found at 0x18"}`

If the extender is not detected, check your wiring and pin configuration.

If sucessful, you should be able to see the changes in Tasmota main web page. Following example has 8 IO lines defined as relays:

### Configuration example

You can add all necessary settings at once in your `user_config_override.h`. The following example adds 8 relays (commanded with POWER1 to POWER8), PCA9557 has all address bits tied to GND (0x18) while ESP8266 GPIO 0 and 2 are used for I2C SDA and SCL.
```
#define USE_PCA9557
#define USE_PCA9557_ADDR 0x18

#define USER_TEMPLATE "{\"NAME\":\"Lights\",\"GPIO\":[608,0,640,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\"FLAG\":0,\"BASE\":18}"
#define USER_RULE1 "On file#pca9557.dat DO {\"NAME\":\"Lights\",\"BASE\":0,\"GPIO\":[256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263]} ENDON"
```
