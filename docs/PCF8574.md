# PCF8574 / PCF8574A GPIO Expander

!!! Warning
    The driver for PCF8574 is not included in any of Tasmota prebuild binaries. See [compiling for PCF8574](#compiling-for-pcf8574).

## Introduction

PCF8574 and PCF8574A are I2C 8-bit IO port extender originally designed by Philips (now NXP) but also 
now available from various manufacturer.

* PCF8574 and PCF8574A at [NXP](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8574_PCF8574A.pdf)
* [PCF8574](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcf8574.pdf) and [PCF8574A](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcf8574a.pdf) at Texas Instruments

As usual when using an electronic part, reading the datasheet is highly recommended as the below 
document only focus on Tasmota integration.

A few different breakout boards are available although some are dedicated to be mounted as a backpack on
standard 16x2 or 16x4 LCD displays and are not suitable for general I/Os (but works well with tasmota-display).

#### Supported I2C addresses and number of PCF8574

PCF8574 and PCF8574A are identical functionally and each can be configured to work on 1 of 8 possible I2C address.
PCF8574 can use one address of 0x20 to 0x27 and PCF8574A can use one of 0x38 to 0x3F.

As of today, Tasmota driver supports:

* Up to 4 PCF8574 OR PCF8574A is supported by Tasmota allowing up to 32 additional GPIO pins.
* Addresses 0x27 and 0x38 are excluded to avoid conflict with other I2C peripheral which can't 
  be differentiated at run-time.

!!! warning "If USE_MCP230xx_ADDR is defined, this address is reserved for MCP230XX IO expander."

## Compiling Additional Features

The PCF8574 driver is not included by default in any Tasmota [build](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/BUILDS.md).
In order to use it you must [compile](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Compile-your-build/) your own tasmota build
by adding the following lines to your `user_config_override.h`:
``` c++
#define USE_I2C                                // Add support for I2C
#define USE_PCF8574                            // [I2cDriver2] Enable PCF8574 I/O Expander (I2C addresses 0x20 - 0x26 and 0x39 - 0x3F) (+1k9 code)
// #define USE_PCF8574_SENSOR                   // enable PCF8574 inputs and outputs in SENSOR message
// #define USE_PCF8574_DISPLAYINPUT             // enable PCF8574 inputs display in Web page
// #define USE_PCF8574_MQTTINPUT                // enable MQTT message & rule process on input change detection : stat/%topic%/PCF8574_INP = {"Time":"2021-03-07T16:19:23+01:00","PCF8574-1_INP":{"D1":1}}
```

The first 2 lines are mandatory to enable I2C support and including the driver in the build. The 3 other lines allows to add optional features to support inputs.
By default only the "outputs" feature is enabled.

## Tasmota Configuration

!!! note 
    Once the firmware with the PCF8574 driver has been loaded, make sure to have it enabled with `I2Cdriver22 1`.

PCF8574 can be configured from Tasmota web GUI in "Configure" => "Configure PCF8574"
![PCF8574 configuration screen](_media/pcf8574_configure.png)

Each IO port can be configured as Input or Output in a similar way as a native GPIO of the ESP.

If you are using outputs to drive relays, it is possible to choose if the relay is activated by a 
HIGH signal (checkbox "Invert Ports" unchecked) or a LOW signal (checkbox checked). The selection 
applies to all output ports. This checkbox can also be controlled by [SetOption81](Commands#setoption81).

Once configuration is complete, it must be saved by clicking on the green "Save" button. Like for 
general ESP GPIO configuration, this will trigger a reboot of the ESP.

!!! note "It is not possible to change pin definition at run-time."

## Outputs

A PCF8574 pin configured as an output support all features of a Tasmota `Relay` component.

It is assigned a Power index and can be controlled by [Power](Commands#power) command (on, off, toggle).
Power indexes of PCF8574 outputs are assigned after the ESP GPIO configured as `Relay`. For example,
if you have Relay 1 (Power1) to Relay 4 (Power4) configured on the ESP's GPIO, PCF8574 outputs will start at Power5.

A state text and an on/off button are automatically created on the Web GUI and syncs with the pin state.

All `Power` features are supported including `PowerOnState`, `PulseTime`, `Blink`, `SetOption0`, ...

## Inputs

In order to use PCF8574 inputs, you must add at least one of the following build-time options in
your `user_config_override.h`:

``` c++
#define USE_PCF8574_SENSOR                   // enable PCF8574 inputs and outputs in SENSOR message
#define USE_PCF8574_DISPLAYINPUT             // enable PCF8574 inputs display in Web page
#define USE_PCF8574_MQTTINPUT                // enable MQTT message & rule process on input change detection : stat/%topic%/PCF8574_INP = {"Time":"2021-03-07T16:19:23+01:00","PCF8574-1_INP":{"D1":1}}
```

### Usage

Enabling `USE_PCF8574_SENSOR` adds a `PCF8574-xx` field into the JSON payload of the `tele/topic/SENSOR`
message. The form of the message is:
``` json
{"Time":"2021-03-11T19:50:58+01:00","PCF8574-1":{"D0":1,"D1":1,"D2":1,"D3":1,"D4":0,"D5":0,"D6":0,"D7":0}}
``` 

As you can see, all pins are listed, including both inputs and outputs. The value reported is the
digital level of the pin. If "Invert Ports" has been enabled, `Power ON` will be reported as 0 as
the pin is at a LOW level.

As for any sensor published in the `tele/topic/SENSOR` message, it is possible to use Rules triggers such as:
```
ON tele-PCF8574-1#D0 DO something_with %value% ENDON
```
Numerical operators such as `==` can be used to compare to 0 or 1. See also [change detection](#input-change-detection).

### PCF8574 inputs pins in the Web GUI

Enabling `USE_PCF8574_DISPLAYINPUT` will add the state of PCF8574 inputs displayed as sensors
in the Web GUI. Outputs are not represented here as they are already shown as Power.

![PCF8574 inputs GUI](_media/pcf8574_inputgui.png)

Value of pin is updated in almost "real-time".

### Input Change Detection

While reporting the pin level in SENSOR or on the GUI is interesting, it is even better to
detect pin change. This is enabled by `USE_PCF8574_MQTTINPUT`. When this feature is enabled at
build time, a test will be performed every 50ms to detect if an input pin has changed. In that case,
Tasmota will publish on `stat/topic/PCF8574_INP` a JSON payload with the PCF8574 index
and the pin level:
``` json
20:19:39.385 MQT: stat/topic/PCF8574_INP = {"Time":"2021-03-11T20:19:39+01:00","PCF8574-1_INP":{"D0":0}}
20:19:39.584 MQT: stat/topic/PCF8574_INP = {"Time":"2021-03-11T20:19:39+01:00","PCF8574-1_INP":{"D0":1}}
```

This can be caught in rules such as:

Implementing a Power push "Button":
``` haskel
ON PCF8574-1_INP#D0=0 DO Power2 toggle ENDON
```
