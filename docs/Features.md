Tasmota contains myriad features and supported peripherals (sensors, controllers and similar). Due to the flash size and memory constraints of ESP8266 not all features can be included in precompiled release binaries.

To enable some of the features you have to [compile](Compile-your-build.md) your own binary. Each feature with such requirement has a warning with instructions on how to enable it.
