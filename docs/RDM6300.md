# RDM6300 RFID reader

??? tip "This feature is included only in `tasmota-sensors` and `tasmota32` binaries" 

    When [compiling your build](Compile-your-build) add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
    ```c++
    #ifndef USE_RDM6300 
    #define USE_RDM6300			// Add support for RDM6300 125kHz RFID Reader (+0k8)
    #endif
    ```

[RDM6300](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/RDM6300) 125KHz cardreader mini-module is designed for reading code from 125KHz card compatible read-only tags and read/write card.

### Warning
There seems to be an issue with some card readers!(the cheap ones?)
These output some fake/ghost readings that look like valid card numbers and validate thru the XOR method but are not real.
This is confirmed by multiple users. Please see details in issue [#9952](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/9522).
There seem to not be issues yet with [SeeedStudio Grove 125Khz Reader](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-125KHz_RFID_Reader/) or RDM630

## Configuration
Sensor uses serial interface for communication.

### Wiring
| RDM6300   | ESP |
|---|---|
|TX   |GPIOx 
|RX   |GPIOy
|Pin3      | unused
|GND   |GND   
|VCC   |5V   


### Tasmota Settings 

_Update 12.10.2020:_
Seems there is a new driver and you can use **RDM6300 RX** instead of the _SerBr Tx_ and _SerBr Rx_.
This also seems to show the last card read in the management interface.
As a note, the card number that comes from the _SerBr_ was 12 chars and the _RDM6300_ one has only 8, being stripped by the first 2 and last 2 chars.

In the **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** page assign:

1. GPIOx to `SerBr Tx (71)`
2. GPIOy to `SerBr Rx (72)`

If the RFID Tag is held in front of the Antenna the reader starts sending the Tag ID. The Tag Id is prefaced with a 0x02 and the end is delimited with a 0x03. If the reader reads the tag multiple times you would get one line with multiple times the Tag ID. For this to separate you can add a SerialDelimiter of 0x03. This will split the result from the serial into several single mqtt messages. But (probably) all the messages wil be prepended with a binary 0x02.

Set [SerialDelimiter](Commands.md#serialdelimiter) to 3
```
SerialDelimiter 3
```
