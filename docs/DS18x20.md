# DS18x20 temperature sensor

??? tip "This feature is included in `tasmota`, `tasmota32`, `tasmota-knx` and `tasmota-display` binaries" 
    When [compiling your build](Compile-your-build) add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
    ```c++
    #ifndef USE_DS18x20
    #define USE_DS18x20               // Add support for DS18x20 sensors with id sort, single scan and read retry (+2k6 code)
    //  #define W1_PARASITE_POWER     // Optimize for parasite powered sensors
    #endif
    ```

DS18x20 driver supports [DS18B20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS18B20.html), [DS18S20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS18S20.html), [DS1822](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS1822.html) and [MAX31850](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/MAX31850.html) 1-Wire digital temperature sensors.

## Configuration

### Wiring
| DS18b20   | ESP |
|---|---|
|1 GND   |GND   |
|2 Data  |GPIOx   |
|3 VCC   |3.3v   |

!!! Warning "Warning: DS18x20 will not work on GPIO16"

You need to connect a 4.7K pullup resistor from data to 3.3V.

### Tasmota Settings
In the **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** page assign:

GPIOx to `DS18x20`

After a reboot the driver will display Temperature.

#### Shelly 1 Temperature Addon
Shelly dual pin mode is supported by an additional pin assignment:

- GPIOy to `DS18x20-o`   

### Commands
[`SetOption74`](Commands.md#setoption74) may be used to enable/disable internal pullup when using a ***single*** DS18x20 sensor (for multiple sensors, you have to use an external pullup resistor).

[`SetOption126`](Commands.md#setoption126) Enable arithmetic mean over teleperiod for JSON temperature for DS18x20 sensors.

[`TempRes`](Commands.md#TempRes) Temperature sensor resolution: 0..3 = maximum number of decimal places.

[`TempOffset`](Commands.md#tempoffset) can be used to add/sub an offset to the measured temperature. This setting affects **all** temperature sensors on the device.

### Multiple Sensors
Tasmota supports multiple DS18x20 sensors connected to a single ESP8266 chip using a single GPIO (multiple DS18x20 GPIO are not supported). The default maximum is set to 8 ([driver code](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/tasmota/xsns_05_ds18x20.ino#L42)). It is possible to override this number in `user_config_override.h` by adding a line with `#define DS18X20_MAX_SENSORS <new-value>` (ESP8266 only). However one should take into account that:

* Display on the console is limited and SENSOR log will be truncated above 11 DS18x20.
* MQTT buffer length is limited and SENSOR message will be truncated above 18 DS18x20. 
* Even less if other sensors are attached to the ESP device and present in the SENSOR message.
* 1-wire has been designed to be a board-bus, not to run through long distances across a whole house. At minimum, use a shielded cable.

!!! note 
    If you increase the value above default, you are on your own. No support will be provided.

Every sensors will get a unique ID used in webUI and MQTT telemetry.

```json
{"Time":"2021-01-02T09:09:44","DS18B20-1":{"Id":"00000566CC39","Temperature":13.3},"DS18B20-2":{"Id":"0000059352D4","Temperature":1.2},"DS18B20-3":{"Id":"000005937C90","Temperature":22.5},"TempUnit":"C"}
```

### Compile Options

There are some compile options ([driver code](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/tasmota/xsns_05_ds18x20.ino#L28)):

`USE_DS18x20_RECONFIGURE`:  When sensor is lost keep retrying or re-configure    
`DS18x20_USE_ID_AS_NAME`:   Use last 3 bytes for naming of sensors

## ESP-01 Wiring Notes

!!! danger
    BEWARE OF MANY VISUALLY SIMILAR BOARDS TO THIS RELAY BOARD but different schematics

<img alt="ESP-01S" src="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/_media/ESP-01-Pin-Out.png" style="margin:10px;float:right;width:20em"> </img>

Some modules have culprits:
* "CH_PD" is not set to HI (3.3V) as actually required. Usually this is done with a 10K resistor or directly to 3.3V, I have connected directly to the 3.3V
* A resistor (R2 10k) which is connected between the terminal GPIO0 to ground. This ensures that the GPIO0 is always pulled to ground, which actually places the ESP-01 in program mode (flashing). **To make the module working it is necessary to remove (solder out).**

Connect DS18B20 to the GPIO2 (see diagram below - **soldering not necessary**, it is possible to put the wires and the resistor directly in to the female part of the connector together with ESP 01S module pins)

After flashing, set up Tasmota (see images below):
* "Generic module"
* GPIO0 as Relay 1
* GPIO2 as DS18x20 

## Rule Triggers

The following trigger events are supported for use in [Rules](Rules.md):

Single sensor attached:
```
  ON DS1820#Temperature DO <command> ENDON
```
Multiple sensors attached:
```
  ON DS1820_1#Temperature DO <command> ENDON
  ON DS1820_2#Temperature DO <command> ENDON
  ON DS1820_3#Temperature DO <command> ENDON
  ON DS1820_..#Temperature DO <command> ENDON
```
Example:
```
 ON DS1820_1#Temperature!=%Var1% DO backlog publish espTempertature/sensor/DS1820_1/data %value%; Var1 %value% ENDON
```
