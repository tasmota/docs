This driver allows the control of Eqiva TRV's (i.e. Thermostat Radiator Valve). Compatible models are:

* Eqiva eQ-3 Bluetooth Smart (141771E0/141771E0A)
* Eqiva eQ-3 Bluetooth Smart(UK Version) (142461D0)

Other Eqiva EQ3 models should work as well, but make sure you select a Bluetooth model as there are also non-Bluetooth models.

### Compiling from source
In order to have EQ3 valves working when compiling from source you need to add these define in `user_config_override.h`:
```c++
#ifdef USE_EQ3_ESP32
   #undef USE_EQ3_ESP32
#endif
#define USE_EQ3_ESP32
```

### Setup
Before you can use the TRV you will need to enable Bluetooth on the TRV:

1. Press the Mode/Menu button for at least 3 seconds.
2. Select the menu item `bLE` with the control wheel and confirm by pressing the
control wheel shortly.
3. The display will show `OFF` to deactivate the function or `On` to activate the
function.
4. Confirm by pressing the control wheel shortly.
 
!!! note "Note: No need to pair the TRV"

Next you will need to make sure that BLE is enabled in Tasmota:

1. Configuration
2. Configure BLE
3. Enable Bluetooth

To determine the mac addresses of a TRV:

1. Go to the BLE menu in Tasmota
2. Enable active scan
3. In to the tasmota console: TRV devlist

This will give you the mac address of each valve.

        
!!! note "Note"
                                                                  
    * Enable 1 valve at a time as this makes it easier to identify
    * You might need to wait a minute or so or repeat the "TRV devlist" command a few times before the devices have been properly identified
    * Keep in mind that the TRV does NOT report the current temperature, only the requested, target, temperature. The Xiaomi Thermometer LYWSD03MMC makes a perfect combo for measuring the room temperature (~USD 4)

After configuring, tasmota will poll the discovered valves and publish their state under `stat/EQ3/<MAC Adress>` (or `stat/EQ3/<BLEAlias>` if you have configured an alias for the MAC address of the valve using `BLEAlias`).

The interval between polls can be configured using `TRVPeriod`. Tasmots needs to have an NTP or RTC time configured for this to work.

### Operating your TRV

There are 2 ways to control your TRV:

* The Tasmota Console (convenient for setup)<br>
    syntax: `TRV <MAC Address> <command> [options]`<br>
    example: `TRV 001A2216A458 settemp 21.5`
* MQTT:<br>
    syntax: `cmnd/<tasmota_topic>/EQ3/<MAC Address>/command [options]`<BR>
    example: `cmnd/ble_esp32/EQ3/001A2216A458/settemp 22.5`

As you can see from the example the MQTT topic is made of:

* Standard Tasmota `%prefix%` : `cmnd`, `stat`
* `%topic%` of the BLE_ESP32 gateway device, here `ble_esp32`
* An `EQ3` element to specify this command is specific to the EQ3 driver
* The MAC address or alias of the EQ3
* The command to the EQ3 or result from the EQ3

The EQ3 TRV has 3 modes of operation:

Mode|Description
:---|:---
auto|follows the week program. A temperature different from the week program can be set any time, but at the next programmed timeslot the TRV will switch back to the given temperature
manual|keeps the current requested temperature
holiday|keeps the temperature requested for the period of holiday and then switches back to the mode that was active before: *auto* or *manual*

These 3 modes can be set and configured using different commands
described below. After submitting a command you will see one or more of
the possible
results.

Status|Description
:---|:---
queued|Command has been accepted by the BLE driver
DONENOTIFIED|Command has been successfully processed by the TRV and the results are send in a json format
ignoredbusy|Currently we can only accept a single command in the queue, during the processing of a TRV command subsequent commands will be rejected. Please resubmit.
FAILCONNECT|After 3 automatic retries we were not able to contact the TRV and we give up. Please resubmit

Under normal circumstance you will get a JSON formatted response from the valve:

```json
{
  "cmd": "settemp",
  "result": "ok",
  "MAC": "001A2216A458",
  "tas": "ble-esp32-0936",
  "RSSI": -79,
  "stattime": 1642328707,
  "temp": 21.0,
  "posn": 95,
  "mode": "auto",
  "hassmode": "auto",

  "windowtemp": 12.0,
  "windowdur": 15,
  "day": 21.0,
  "night": 17.0,
  "offset": 0.0
}
```

If the mode is *holiday,* "holidayend" will show when the holiday period
and mode is about to end:

```json
{
  "mode": "holiday",
  "holidayend": "22-01-19 17:00"
}
```

In the response for the command *setprofile,* "profiledayset" will be
added:

```json
{
  "cmd": "setprofile",
  "profiledayset": 4
}
```

In the response for the command *reqprofile,* "profileday*n*" (n=0…6)
will be
added:

```json
{
  "cmd": "reqprofile",
  "profileday4": "17.0-07:00,23.0-10:00,17.0-17:00,21.0-23:00,17.0-24:00"
}
```
