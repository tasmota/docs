## Editing Articles

!!! failure "You need a GitHub user account to be able to edit"

If you spot an error in an article use the *pencil icon* link at the top of the page, near the title, to correct it. This version of documentation uses strict markdown syntax with some enhancements. See [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for all features

You'll be taken to the GitHub repository page of that file, after a "fork" (copy) of the docs are made into your own GitHub account.

Click on the **edit** button (pencil icon). Edit/Add the text you wanted. When finished find the **Propose changes** button at the bottom and click it.
