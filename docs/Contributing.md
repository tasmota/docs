## Editing articles

!!! failure "You need a GitHub user account to be able to edit"

If you spot an error in an article, use the *pencil icon* link (see image below) at the top of the related [documentation GitHub repository page](https://github.com/tasmota/docs) to correct it.

This version of documentation uses strict markdown syntax with some enhancements.
See [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for all features.

You'll be taken to the GitHub repository page of that article file, after a "fork" (copy) of the docs is made into your own GitHub account.

Click on the **edit** button (pencil icon). Edit/Add the text you wanted. When finished find the **Propose changes** button at the bottom and click it.
