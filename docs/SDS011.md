Nova PM Sensor SDS011 can measure the air quality very accurately by measuring air particles or dust based on laser detection.

Specifications:

* Voltage: 4.7 - 5.3V DC (5V DC with <20mV ripple advised)
* Power consumption: 70mA ±10mA (in operation), <4mA (laser and fan sleep mode)
* Measuring range: 0.0-999.9 μg/m3
* PM2.5 and PM10 output

See [manufacturer site](http://www.inovafitness.com/en/a/chanpinzhongxin/95.html) for more information.

## Configuration

### Wiring
| SDS011   | ESP8266 |
|---|---|

To extend the lifetime of the sensor, you can use the command [Sensor20](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#sensor20) in association with setting TelePeriod for how often you want the fan to run and the sensor to be polled.


### Tasmota Main
After reboot of the device the displays the SDS011 measurements.
