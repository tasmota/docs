# CC253x Zigbee module

!!! info "The CC2530 or CC2531 is a system-on-chip (SoC) for Zigbee communication"

Any Texas Instruments CC2530 or CC2531 chip based module can serve as a coordinator if it has [Z-Stack firmware flashed](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/flashing_ccloader.html). See [list of supported modules](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/zigbee2tasmota.html) with their pinouts and flashing instructions since they are different for each device.

!!! info
    Z-Stack 1.2 is fully supported in Tasmota. There is preliminary support for Z-Stack 3.x as of Tasmota v9.2.0.4.

!!! info
    You cannot use a CC2531 in USB mode! Flash it with CC2530 firmware and it will work in serial mode. You will have to wire it for serial communication using TX and RX pins, USB port cannot be used for communicating with the CC2531 chip.


## Wi-Fi Adapter
Using an ESP82xx device such as a Wemos D1 Mini or a NodeMCU to [flash the CC2530](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/flashing_ccloader.html) is a lower cost alternative than using a single purpose [CC_DEBUGGER](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32869263224.html). 

In normal operation two free GPIOs are needed for the serial communication with the CC2530.  

### Custom PCBs
These PCBs make all the connections required to flash the CC2530 and to run Z2T:

#### SuperHouse.tv  
  Jon Oxer created a [custom PCB](https://github.com/SuperHouse/Z2T) to connect a Wemos D1 Mini and a CC2530 board (with or without CC2591).

## Configuration
### Flash Zigbee Adapter 
Zigbee2Tasmota requires a TI CC2530 based module flashed with [Z-Stack CC2530 firmware file](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_Home_1.2/bin/default) from [Koen Kanters](https://github.com/Koenkk). 

Due to memory constraints of the CC2530, you can only pair 16 devices to a coordinator ([See details](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator)). 

!!! note
    There is an alternative firmware allowing for Zigbee routers to create a mesh network and go beyond 16 devices. This is currently not tested nor supported by Zigbee2Tasmota. It may be added later.

Flashing options:

- Flashing with [CCLoader](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/flashing_ccloader.html) and ESP8266 ==(recommended)==
- Flashing with [CCLib](Zigbee-CCLib-Flashing.md) and ESP8266
- Flash with a dedicated [CC Debugger](https://ptvo.info/how-to-select-and-flash-cc2530-144/) and PC 

### Flash Tasmota
Once the flashing process completes, you can re-use the ESP82xx and flash Tasmota with Zigbee2Tasmota enabled firmware. Otherwise, you can use any ESP82xx device.  

!!! failure "Zigbee feature is not included in precompiled binaries"

To use it you must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
```arduino
#define USE_ZIGBEE 
```
#### Optional 
Run the ESP at 160MHz instead of 80MHz which ensures higher reliability in serial communication with CC2530.

In `platformio_override.ini` uncomment line 51:

`board_build.f_cpu = 160000000L`
  
If you find that your Zigbee2Tasmota operation is unstable, you may have an ESP82xx device that cannot operate reliably at the higher frequency. If you are using hardware serial (see below) and you still have unreliability, try compiling for 80MHz (reverse the options above) and flash the ESP82xx device again to see if operating at a lower frequency improves stability. Running at 80MHz will impact software serial communications so hardware serial is highly recommended if running the ESP82xx at 80MHz.
    
Flash the newly compiled binary usig the [normal flashing process](Getting-Started.md#flashing).

### Connect CC2530 to Tasmota
If you are using your ESP82xx device to flash the Zigbee adapter as described in tutorials you may want to leave these connections in place in case you ever need to update Zigbee firmware. If not, any of the free GPIOs can be used.

!!! note "It is recommended that hardware serial pins be used (GPIO1/GPIO3 or GPIO13\[Rx]/GPIO15\[Tx])"
    Due to ESP82xx GPIO pin constraints, GPIO15 can only be used as serial Tx.  

The interface between the ESP82xx Wi-Fi device and the Zigbee module uses high speed serial. 

!!! tip
    Tasmota also provides serial communications emulation through software (i.e., software serial). This allows any GPIO to be used. TasmotaSerial version 2.4.x (PR [#6377](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/6377)) has improved the reliability of software serial making it feasible for use in this application. However, if you have an option to use hardware serial, choose that.

!!! bug "Z2T uses software serial by default to allow for serial logging on GPIO1/GPIO3"
    Use `SerialLog 0` to enable **hardware serial on GPIO13\[Rx]/GPIO15\[Tx]**.

Recommended wiring:  

ESP<BR>Device|Tasmota|<BR>Zigbee Module
:--:|:--:|:--:
GPIO13|Zigbee RX (166)|CC_TXD<BR>(A.K.A. P0_3)
GPIO15|Zigbee TX (165)|CC_RXD<BR>(A.K.A. P0_2)
3V3 | VCC
GND | GND 

### Tasmota Settings 
In the **Configuration -> Configure Module** page assign:

- GPIO13 to `Zigbee RX (166)`   
- GPIO15 to `Zigbee TX (165)`

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/64920989-ec043400-d7bd-11e9-8f5c-74ece5c4e26c.jpg" width="240">

You can quickly configure Tasmota using a custom template instead. 

Use this one for the recommended wiring scheme:

```json
{"NAME":"Zigbee","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,166,0,165,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```


### First Run

When the Tasmota device boots, Zigbee2Tasmota will wait for 15 seconds before initializing the CC2530. This time allows for Wi-Fi and MQTT to connect (hopefully).

First boot:
```
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":1,"Message":"CC2530 booted","RestartReason":"Watchdog","MajorRel":2,"MinorRel":6}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":50,"MajorRel":2,"MinorRel":6,"MaintRel":3,"Revision":20190608}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":2,"Message":"Reseting configuration"}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":3,"Message":"Configured, starting coordinator"}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":51,"IEEEAddr":"0x00124B00199DF06F","ShortAddr":"0x0000","DeviceType":7,"DeviceState":9,"NumAssocDevices":0}}
MQT: tele/tasmota/Zigbee_home/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":0,"Message":"Started"}}
ZIG: Zigbee started
ZIG: No zigbee devices data in Flash
```

Zigbee will automatically boot the CC2530 device, configure the device and wait for Zigbee messages.

Normal boot looks like:  
```
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":1,"Message":"CC2530 booted","RestartReason":"Watchdog","MajorRel":2,"MinorRel":6}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":50,"MajorRel":2,"MinorRel":6,"MaintRel":3,"Revision":20190608}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":3,"Message":"Configured, starting coordinator"}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":51,"IEEEAddr":"0x00124B00199DF06F","ShortAddr":"0x0000","DeviceType":7,"DeviceState":9,"NumAssocDevices":0}}
MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":0,"Message":"Started"}}
ZIG: Zigbee started
ZIG: Zigbee devices data in Flash (516 bytes)
```

!!! info "You can force a factory reset of your CC2530 with `ZigbeeReset 1` and reboot"
