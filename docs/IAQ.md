# iAQ-Core indoor air quality sensor

??? failure "This component is no longer in production and not recommended for further uses. Manufacturer AppliedSensor changed ownership/name in 2015 to ams AG and in 2019 to Sciosense. New released product is ENS161."

??? failure "This feature is not included in precompiled binaries"  

    When [compiling your build](Compile-your-build) add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
    ```arduino
    #ifndef USE_IAQ
    #define USE_IAQ         // [I2cDriver46] Enable iAQ-core air quality sensor (I2C address 0x5a) (+0k6 code)
    #endif
    ```

The iAQ-core indoor air quality module is a low-cost, ultra compact solution for detecting poor air quality. This module uses micro-machined metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology to detect a broad range of VOCs while correlating directly with CO~2~ and TVOC levels in the room.

!!! warning
    All testing and driver programming has been done using iAQ-Core C sensor model. We don't know whether **iAQ-Core P** will work with this driver.

## Configuration
#### Wiring
Follow datasheet for required pull-ups when connecting the bare sensor module directly to ESP8266. Wemos and NodeMCU board include the required pull-up.

| Breakout | ESP   |
|----------|-----------|
| VCC/VIN  | +3.3VDC   |
| GND      | GND       |
| SCL      | GPIOy  |
| SDA      | GPIOx  |

#### Tasmota Settings
In the **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** page assign:

1. GPIOx to `I2C SDA`
2. GPIOy to `I2C SCL`

After configuring the GPIO's the driver will detect iAQ-Core automatically.

On every power on sensor will run in _Warm up_ mode for 5 minutes to calibrate. During this webUI shows:

![webUI warmup](_media/peripherals/iaq-warmup.jpg)

and console displays `iAQ: Error 10`

When warm-up is finished, sensor will show readings in web UI:

![webUI readout](_media/peripherals/iaq-readout.jpg)

and in MQTT topic (according to TelePeriod):    
```
{"Time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00","IAQ":{"eCO2":450,"TVOC":125,"Resistance":76827}}
```

## Usage
Typical sensor reading should be around 450 ppm eCO~2~ and 125 ppb TVOC. Resistance is sensor's gas resistance in Ohm and is the baseline reading from which eCO~2~ and TVOC are calculated from

If you see error messages in console, take appropriate action:

`iAQ: Error 1`    
During use, a message `iAQ: Error 1` will randomly appear. This is normal, it's a skipped reading due to sensor still taking environment data during polling.

`iAQ: Error 80`    
If this error persists, the sensor is broken and should be replaced.

`iAQ: Error ff`    
General connection error. Check your wiring and if the power supply supplies enough power to the sensor. Run `I2CScan` to check if the sensor can be found on 0x5a I^2^C address.
