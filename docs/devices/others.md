This USB powered or external powered board provides one GPIO controlling two alternating relays with Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) contacts. It can be used for changing directions of a connected motor.

Programming the on-board 3.3V [PSA-B](https://www.itead.cc/psa-01.html) is possible when Rx (Pin 7), Tx (Pin 8) and GND (Pin 9) are connected to the FTDI interface, the button is pressed and (USB) power is provided.
