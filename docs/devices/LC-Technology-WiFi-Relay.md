## LC Technology WiFi Relay - Single Relay

The LC Technology relay devices use GPIO1 and GPIO3 for the serial communications used to control the relays. You do not need to specify these in the template. `SerialSend` uses these standard serial communications GPIO by default.

In order to use LC Technology WiFi Relay for 1 relay version:

* Set module to Generic (18) (in module configuration and click save)
* Set D3 GPIO0 as Relay1 (21) (in module configuration and click save)
* Disable SerialLog (type `seriallog 0` in the Tasmota console)
* Add the following rules typing in the console:
  ```
  Rule1
   on System#Boot do Backlog Baudrate 9600; SerialSend5 0 endon
   on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
   on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
  ```
* Enable the rule (type `rule1 1` in the Tasmota console)
* Note: If you use LC Technology v1.2 and this rule does not work, try to use 115200 baudrate
* Note: If that doesn't work for you, you may find that using `Power1#Boot` as the event to trigger the baud rate setting (instead of `System#Boot`) works, as it did for me. So the alternate rule is:
  ```
  on Power1#Boot do Backlog Baudrate 9600; SerialSend5 0 endon
  on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
  on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
  ```

## LC Technology WiFi Relay - Dual Relay (note, older versions of this board used a baud rate of 9600, so if 115200 doesn't work, try 9600)

To configure an LC Technology ESP8266 Relay X2, use the following settings...

* Set module to Generic (in module configuration and click save)
* Set GPIO0 and GPIO2 as Relay1 and Relay 2 (in module configuration and click save)
* Disable SerialLog (type ``seriallog 0`` in the Tasmota console)
* Add the following rules typing in the Tasmota console:
  ```
  Rule1
   on System#Boot do Backlog Baudrate 9600; SerialSend5 0 endon
   on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
   on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
   on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon
   on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon
  ```
* Enable the rule (type `rule1 1` in the Tasmota console)  

## LC Technology WiFi Relay - Quad Relay (note, older versions of this board used a baud rate of 9600, so if 115200 doesn't work, try 9600)

Note: The template provided below did not work on an ESP-01 running Tasmota 8.1.0. It was necessary to manually enter the template in the `Configure Template` menu.

* In configuration open `Configure Other` paste this template and select activate
`{"NAME":"LC Technology 4CH Relay","GPIO":[52,255,17,255,255,255,255,255,21,22,23,24,255],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}`
* Open `Configure Module` and set GPIO0, GPIO2, GPIO4 and GPIO5 as Relay1, Relay2, Relay3 and Relay4. Click Save.
* Disable SerialLog (type ``seriallog 0`` in the Tasmota console)

Enter this command in console (configure the 1st rule)  
```
Rule1
 on System#Boot do Backlog Baudrate 9600; SerialSend5 0 endon
 on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
 on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
 on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon
 on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon
 on Power3#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00301A4 endon
 on Power3#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00300A3 endon
 on Power4#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00401A5 endon
 on Power4#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00400A4 endon
```
Enable the rule (type `rule1 1` in the Tasmota console)  

If your relay is still not switching, check the LED on the board.
If LED D5 is on (blue on my board, the middle LED) then the controller is in Mode 2.
By pressing S2 while power up you can change back to Mode 1.
After that the LED D7 is on ( red in my case) an the device works like a charm.
Be carefull when you press S1 you change the mode again!

## LC Technology WiFi Relay X2 with Nuvoton N76E003AT20

Note: This version of the board has the Nuvoton N76E003AT20 as its host microcontroller instead of  STC15F104W. This device requires a special configuration for it to start listening to serial commands.

Use the following device template, configureable in `Configure Other`:

```
{"NAME":"LC-ESP01-2R-5V","GPIO":[0,148,0,149,0,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```

Add the following rules:

```
on System#Boot do Backlog Baudrate 115200
on SerialReceived#Data=41542B5253540D0A do SerialSend5 5749464920434f4e4e45435445440a5749464920474f542049500a41542b4349504d55583d310a41542b4349505345525645523d312c383038300a41542b43495053544f3d333630 endon
on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon
on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon
```

Here's what the above code does line per line:

* Sets the serial baud rate to **115200** (this seems to be the default for the Nuvoton LCTech Relay)
* This sends a certain stream of serial messages (in hex) below after receiving AT+RST (41542B5253540D0A in hex) from the NUVOTON devices. This message seems to make the NUVOTON enter listening mode. The long stream of hex messages for sending is equivalent to the ff. key in ASCII:

```WIFI CONNECTED
WIFI GOT IP
AT+CIPMUX=1
AT+CIPSERVER=1,8080
AT+CIPSTO=360
```

* The PowerX#State=xxx... messages are triggers to send serial messages to the NUVOTON chip.

Do not forget to enable the rule.

After the device receives the bypass key, it wouldn't immediately respond to commands. The ESP has to wait for the following return messages echoed back to Serial first:

```
AT+CIPMUX=1
AT+CIPSERVER=1,8080
AT+CIPSTO=360
```

After these messages are sent back by Nuvoton to the ESP, the green LED beside the green LED will start blinking once a second. From here you can verify that the relay indeed starts to receive commands from the ESP.

## LC Technology WiFi Relay X4 with Nuvoton N76E003AT20

Note: This version of the board has the Nuvoton N76E003AT20 as its host microcontroller instead of  STC15F104W. Becareful, not working with Nuvoton MS51FB9AE.
Same special configuration than with X2 relay version with Nuvoton N76E003AT20.

Use the following device template, configureable in `Configure Other`:

```
{"NAME":"LC-ESP01-4R-12V","GPIO":[0,148,0,149,0,0,0,0,21,22,23,24,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```

Add the following rules:

```
Rule1
on System#Boot do Backlog Baudrate 115200
on SerialReceived#Data=41542B5253540D0A do SerialSend5 5749464920434f4e4e45435445440a5749464920474f542049500a41542b4349504d55583d310a41542b4349505345525645523d312c383038300a41542b43495053544f3d333630 endon
on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon
on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon
on Power3#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00301A4 endon
on Power3#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00300A3 endon
on Power4#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00401A5 endon
on Power4#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00400A4 endon
Rule1 1
```

Activate the rules:

```
Rule1 1
```

## Beware of counterfeit modules

If your board just [continuously flashes its led when powered on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Le9kNT_Bm4) and no esp-01 is entered, the onboard STC15F104W needs to be programmed! For more details ([link](https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=160&t=13164&start=68#p74262))

Additionally, once programmed, you may also have to remove r4. Some issues exist where r3 and r4 are swapped, but just removing r4 works.

## ESP-01S 5V Relay Module V1.0 Relay

This board will not boot unless R2 is removed or the easier hardware fix below is carried out.
A template is available ([here] (https://templates.blakadder.com/ESP-01S-Relay-v1.html))

## Easier hardware fix

This is an easier fix for the ESP-01S relay v1.0 board, which does not require pcb cuts or resistor desoldering, just a 10K resistor soldered as in image: this mod prevents the relay flicker, and connects ch_pd, too

## How to use with up to 12V power supply

LC Technology WiFi Relay use CJT1117B linear regulator which support input power up to 12V. It is ok for ESP-01 and N76E003, but not for relay. Relay connected without any voltage regulator to input power directly.

The easier way to replace existing relay. Part number for 12V relay is SRD-12VDC-SLC. You can use similar analogs for 6V and 9V.
