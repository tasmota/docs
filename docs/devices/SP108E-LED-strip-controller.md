This is a controller for the WS2812 and similar LED chips (stripes). Prize is 13..15â‚¬ at ebay.
It uses another controller (STM32F0) to control CLK and Data lines to the LEDs tripes.

Warning: Construction zone.

To run Tasmota on it, we need to modify the hardware. See [**here**](SP108E-HardwareMod.md) for details.

Currently not working, see HardwareMod for details: "Other than that, the normal flash instruction for Tasmota do apply."
