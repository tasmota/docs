I didn't spot any headers, but device has a sub-board with an ESP-12 module on it. Solder right to the 3.3V, Ground, TX, RX, and GPIO pins and flash away. I set the device up as a generic device with the following assignments. 

* GPIO 3 is button 2
* GPIO 4 is relay 2
* GPIO 12 is button 1 
* GPIO 13 is relay 1
