The [BlitzWolf SHP2](BlitzWolf-SHP2.md), HomeCube SP1, and Teckin SP22 are basically the same device barring the branding.

# :warning: Warning :warning:

There are at least two Versions of the SP22 out.

An old one with a TYWE2S WiFi module and ESP... chip. This version is compatible with Tasmota.

A new one with a [WR2](https://docs.tuya.com/docDetail?code=K8uhkbx75kg7y) WiFi module and RTL8710BN chip. This one is **not compatible with Tasmota.**
