# AS3935 Franklin Lightning sensor

??? tip "This feature is included only in `tasmota-sensors` and `tasmota32` binaries" 

    When [compiling your build](Compile-your-build) add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
    ```c++
    #ifndef USE_AS3935 
    #define USE_AS3935      // [I2cDriver48] Enable AS3935 Franklin Lightning Sensor (I2C address 0x03) (+5k4 code)
    #endif
    ```

The AS3935 is a programmable fully integrated Lightning
Sensor IC that detects the presence and approach of potentially
hazardous lightning activity in the vicinity and provides an
estimation on the distance to the head of the storm. The
embedded lightning algorithm checks the incoming signal
pattern to reject the potential man-made disturbers.

Tasmota driver includes:

- support for all AS3935 Parameters
- support of all related commands for configuration
- support of NF-Auto Function to auto Threshold the Noise Reduction
- support of Auto Disturber
- support of calibrating the internal OSC with switchable Caps

## Configuration

### Wiring
| AS3935   | ESP |
|---|---|
|GND   |GND
|VCC   |3.3V
|SDA   | GPIOx
|SCL   | GPIOy
|IRQ   | GPIOz

!!! warning
    "Sensor uses a software interrupt. Make sure that the connection with the IRQ pin is stable to prevent flicker."

### Tasmota Settings
In the **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** page assign:

1. GPIOx to `I2C SDA`
2. GPIOy to `I2C SCL`
3. GPIOz to `AS3935`

!!! tip "Note for using I^2^C"
    - You will need to wire up all of the associated pins for the different boards  
    - Always connect `CS` and `MISO` to `GND`  
    - If `SI` is present, you need to connect to `VCC`  
    - See some wiring on the [board pictures](#breakout-boards-and-wiring-for-i2c-use) below

After a reboot the driver will detect AS3935 automatically.

!!! note "Note for `AS3935Calibrate`"
    Normally you don't need the calibrate function. If you buy the AS3935, the module has a sticker on it with the calibrated cap. Use `AS3935Settunecaps` for setting up this value. If the calibration fails, it is possible that you have a board with the wrong caps on it! (Some CJMCU-Boards)

!!! tips "Hint and Tips"
    - take a stabilized power supply  
    - keep a distance of at least 200 mm from the ESP and the AS3935  
    - be careful with _ready to use_ devices like Sonoff, etc. They don't have a good power supply inside  
    - use a ferrit clamp filter on the sensor cable  
    - wire all related pins for I^2^C use  

You can find some troubleshooting tips in the [Tasmota GitHub discussion](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/8130).

## Breakout Boards Issues
!!! warning
    Some type of this sensor have wrong capacitors (100pF and 1000pF) installed and the calibration fails. The correct caps are 680pF and 270pF.
