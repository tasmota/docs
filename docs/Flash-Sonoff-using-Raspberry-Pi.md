If you don't have a USB-to-TTL serial adapter available, but you have a Raspberry Pi, you can use this procedure for flashing your device.

[Tutorial](https://www.sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/sonoff/flashing_sonoff_en.html) (a little outdated)

Summarizing the process and needed connections based on the above blog, please refer there for a more detailed explanation :wink:

# Preparation of the Raspberry Pi
1. Install esptool (pip needed)  
   `sudo pip install esptool`

2. Prepare serial connection.  
   _Note: Use the correct serial connection as per your version of the Raspberry Pi._

   | Device        |  Serial Connection      |
   | ------------- |---------------|
   | RaspberryPi 1/2/3 (BT disabled or miniuart) |   /dev/ttyAMA0      |
   | RaspberryPi 3/4          |   /dev/ttyS0      |

   `sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service`

   `sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service`

   `sudo cp /boot/cmdline.txt /boot/cmdline.bak` (This backups the file ;))

   `sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt`
   -> delete "console=serial0,115200" option

3. I donâ€™t know if this is necessary, but I did it as it was mentioned here:  
   https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/

   `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`

   -> add the line (at the bottom):
   `enable_uart=1`

   Please note following overlays setting port to `/dev/ttyAMA0`

   * `pi3-miniuart-bt`
   * `pi3-disable-bt`

4. Reboot your Pi

# Connections
Connect GND, RX->TX and TX->RX as shown below. 

**If you power the device with the 3.3V power from the RPi it will cause it to reboot when connecting.** You can still enter flash mode if you power up the RPi with the 3.3v connected and pressing the connecting GPIO0 to ground (e.g., pressing the button on the Sonoff Basic) simultaneously. It's recommended to use either an external power supply for this or use the 5V GPIO and a 3.3V Voltage Regulator.  
([issue #4807](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/4807))

**Do not connect 3.3V yet!**

(For RaspberryPi 3 (40 GPIO pins) GND is the last pin on the left, the 39th pin.)

This is how it looks in real-life ðŸ˜†

# Flashing the firmware
1. Erase flash memory:
   Connect 3.3V while button pressed for about 10 seconds to enter flash-mode. Then release and run:

   ```bash
   # if using Raspberry Pi 1/2 use
   # esptool.py --port /dev/ttyAMA0 erase_flash

   # if using Raspberry Pi 3 use
   esptool.py --port /dev/ttyS0 erase_flash
   ```
   You should see output like this:

   ```bash
   âžœ  ~ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyS0 erase_flash
   esptool.py v2.5.1
   Serial port /dev/ttyS0
   Connecting....

   ```

2. Flash .bin, which you can download from the [release server](http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/):

   Again connect 3.3V while pressing button for 10 seconds. Then release and run:

   ```bash
   # if using Raspberry Pi 1/2 use
   # esptool.py --port /dev/ttyAMA0 write_flash -fm dout 0x0 /path/to/downloaded/tasmota.bin

   # if using Raspberry Pi 3/4 use
   esptool.py --port /dev/ttyS0 write_flash -fm dout 0x0 /path/to/downloaded/tasmota.bin
   ```

   You should see output like this:

   ```bash
   âžœ  ~ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyS0 write_flash -fm dout 0x0 tasmota.bin
   esptool.py v2.5.1
   Serial port /dev/ttyS0

   ```

3. Setup Wi-Fi:
   - Connect with an external device to the `sonoff-xxxx` Wi-Fi AP and configure over the browser.

   - Alternative: Reboot your device after flashing (toggle power wire) and connect to the serial console via miniterm:

     ```bash
     # if using Raspberry Pi 1/2 use
     # miniterm.py /dev/ttyAMA0 115200 -e

     # if using Raspberry Pi 3/4 use
     miniterm.py /dev/ttyS0 115200 -e
     ```

     You will see some output, after pressing enter.

     Now just type in, your SSID, press enter and then type the passwordâ€¦

     `Backlog ssid yourSSID; password yourPassword`


# Thatâ€™s it :smiley:
