# MI32 legacy

Focus on the passive observation of BLE sensors of the Xiaomi/Mijia universe with a small memory footprint.
Create generic Bluetooth applications with Berry.


## Usage

Currently supported are all members of the ESP32 family with Bluetooth capabilities.
This driver is not part of any standard build. To self compile it is recommended to use `platformio_tasmota_cenv.ini`, which needs to be created first.
Use or change one of the existing example sections with naming scheme `tasmota32xx-mi32`.
??? example "build environment"
    ```
    [env:tasmota32-mi32-legacy]
    extends                 = env:tasmota32_base
    build_flags             = ${env:tasmota32_base.build_flags}
                              -DUSE_MI_ESP32
                              -DUSE_MI_EXT_GUI
                              -DCONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_NVS_PERSIST=y
    lib_extra_dirs          = lib/libesp32, lib/libesp32_div, lib/lib_basic, lib/lib_i2c, lib/lib_div, lib/lib_ssl
    ```

### Bluetooth 5

If you want to try out Bluetooth version 5.x, which consumes a bit more memory and has limited capabilities on the ESP platform itself, a custom build is needed, e.g.:
??? example "build environment BLE 5"
    ```
    [env:tasmota32c3-mi32]
    extends                 = env:tasmota32_base
    board                   = esp32c3
    board_build.flash_mode  = qio
    lib_ignore              = Micro-RTSP
    build_flags             = ${env:tasmota32_base.build_flags}
                              -DFIRMWARE_BLUETOOTH
                              -DUSE_MI_EXT_GUI
                              -DCONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_EXT_ADV
                              -DCONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_MAX_EXT_ADV_INSTANCES=1
                              -DOTA_URL='"http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota32/release/tasmota32c3.bin"'
    custom_sdkconfig        = CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_50_FEATURE_SUPPORT=y
                              CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_EXT_ADV=y
    ;It is probably necessary to restart your IDE (i.e. Visual Studio Code) to see the option to build this environment.
    ```
Basically every consumer BLE device with "BLE 5" capabilities has only hardware support for Bluetooth 5.x.
At the time of writing there is not a single widely used product out there, that has the software support enabled.
The only known exception is the open source firmware on [pvvx.github.io](https://pvvx.github.io) with possible BLE long range support, but due to hardware limitations the ESP32 platform does not gain much (aka nothing) here.

## Tasmota and BLE-sensors

Different vendors offer Bluetooth solutions as part of the XIAOMI family often under the MIJIA-brand (while AQARA is the typical name for a ZigBee sensor).
The sensors supported by Tasmota use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to transmit the sensor data, but they differ in their accessibilities quite substantially.

Basically all of them use of so-called „MiBeacons“ which are BLE advertisement packets with a certain data structure, which are broadcasted by the devices automatically while the device is not in an active bluetooth connection.
The frequency of these messages is set by the vendor and ranges from one per 3 seconds to one per hour (for the battery status of the LYWSD03MMC). Motion sensors and BLE remote controls start to send when an event is triggered.
These packets already contain the sensor data and can be passively received by other devices and will be published regardless if a user decides to read out the sensors via connections or not. Thus the battery life of a BLE sensor is not influenced by reading these advertisements and the big advantage is the power efficiency as no active bi-directional connection has to be established. The other advantage is, that scanning for BLE advertisements can happen nearly parallel (= very quick one after the other), while a direct connection must be established for at least a few seconds and will then block both involved devices for that time.
This is therefore the preferred option, if technically possible (= for the supported sensors).

Most of the „older“ BLE-sensor-devices use unencrypted messages, which can be read by all kinds of BLE-devices or even a NRF24L01. With the arrival of "newer" sensors came the problem of encrypted data in MiBeacons, which can be decrypted in Tasmota.
Meanwhile it is possible to get the needed "bind_key" without the need to use Xiaomis apps and server infrastructure.
At least the LYWSD03 allows the use of a simple BLE connection without any encrypted authentication and the reading of the sensor data using normal subscription methods to GATT-services (currently used on the HM-1x). This is more power hungry than the passive reading of BLE advertisements. It is not directly supported by the driver anymore, but can be realized in Berry, i.e. to read the correct battery status.
Other sensors like the MJYD2S and nearly every newer device are not usable without the "bind_key".

The idea is to provide as many automatic functions as possible. Besides the hardware setup, there are zero or very few things to configure.
The sensor namings are based on the original sensor names and shortened if appropriate (Flower care -> Flora). A part of the MAC will be added to the name as a suffix.
All sensors are treated as if they are physically connected to the ESP32 device. For motion and remote control sensors MQTT-messages will be published in (nearly) real time.

### Supported Devices

!!! note "It can not be ruled out, that changes in the device firmware may break the functionality of this driver completely!"

The naming conventions in the product range of bluetooth sensors in XIAOMI-universe can be a bit confusing. The exact same sensor can be advertised under slightly different names depending on the seller (Mijia, Xiaomi, Cleargrass, ...).
If an unknown "Mijia" sensor is found it will be added with naming scheme `MI_`+`PID` and if the builtin parser of the driver supports the packet type, it will work too.

[passive]: data is received via BLE advertisements  
[active]: data is received via bidirectional connection to the sensor  


#### Devices with payload encryption

The encrypting devices will start to send advertisements with encrypted sensor data after pairing it with the official Xiaomi app. Out-of-the-box the sensors do only publish a static advertisement.
It is possible to do a pairing and get the necessary decryption key ("bind_key") right here in the Wiki. This method uses the same code base as the first published working example: <https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html>.
This project also provides a custom firmware for the LYWSD03MMC, which then becomes an ATC and is supported by Tasmota too. Default ATC-setting will drain the battery more than stock firmware, because of very frequent data sending.
This key and the corresponding MAC of the sensor can be injected with the MI32key-command (or NRFMJYD2S), but the new and recommended option is to use a **mi32cfg** file.

It is still possible to save the whole config as RULE like that:  (not recommended anymore!)

```haskell
rule1 on System#Boot do backlog MI32key 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566; MI32key 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566 endon
```
(key for two sensors)

### Tracking of BLE devices and "iPhone presence detection"

It is possible to track generic BLE devices with `mi32option5 1`. This includes every device with a public address (aka a fixed MAC address) out of the box.
Additionally it is possible to observe (typically more modern) BLE devices with a *Random Private Resolvable Address* or in short RPA, which includes iPhones and other Apple devices.
For the latter it is necessary to retrieve the Identiy Resolving Key (= IRK), which is supported directly by the driver with the help of a Berry script:

??? example " Retrieve IRK from BLE device with RPA"

    ```berry

    class IRK : Driver

        def init()
            import cb
            var cbp = cb.gen_cb(/e,o,u,h->self.cb(e,o,u,h))
            BLE.serv_cb(cbp,cbuf)
            self.current_func = /->self.add_bpm()
            log("BLE: start hearrate server",1)
        end

        def every_50ms()
            self.current_func()
        end

        def wait()
        end

        def then(func)
            # save function pointers for callback, typically expecting a closure
            self.next_func = func
            self.current_func = /->self.wait()
        end

                f.close()
            except ..
                j.push(d)
            end
            f = open("mi32cfg","w")

        end
    end

    var irk = IRK()
    tasmota.add_driver(irk)
    ```

This script can be launched directly from the Berry console and allows the pairing with the desired BLE device by presenting the ESP as a heartrate sensor.
After successful authentication the script will save the MAC and the IRK to the `mi32cfg` file, which will start the tracking after reboot.


## MI32 Configuration

There are several ways to manage and save your configuration.

1. Do it on the device
Starting after a fresh install the driver will not find a configuration file and begins to search for every BLE device, that it can unterstand. Thus after a while all BLE sensors in sight should have been added to the non-persistent internal memory.
You can save them with command `MI32CFG`, which will create a JSON-file named 'mi32cfg' in the root folder of the internal flash of the ESP32. After the next reboot, the driver will read this configuration into memory and does not add more devices to this list.

2. Create the mi32cfg file manually
After a fresh install you can simply create a file in the root folder of the flash file system with the name 'mi32cfg' and paste the JSON into it. Save it and reboot.

3. Adding sensors including the keys directly on this page
It is recommended to paste the data of 'mi32cfg' into the next textfield, if you already have one. After that press IMPORT MI32CFG. The config will get parsed and presented in a table.

### MI32CFG Importer - Web App

<script src="../extra_javascript/mi32/bindkey_loader.js"></script>
<p>MI32CFG <span id='importedDev'>- nothing imported yet</span></p>
<input size="56" type="text" id="result_config" value="" placeholder="paste your mi32cfg here"><br>
<button type="button" class="md-button md-button--primary" onclick="importCfg();">Import MI32Cfg</button>

<span id="mi32cfg_tab">
=== "Table"

    empty config

=== "JSON"

    ``` haskell
    []
    ```



After that you can add more sensors with the following Bind Key Generator, which will also add sensors, that do not need a key. This will only work, if your browser supports this and **should work with Opera, Chrome and Edge**. Safari and Firefox are not able to do this.
After successful pairing a sensor in the next step or simply connecting to a non-encrypting sensor, the JSON in the textfield above will be updated with the added new sensor at the bottom.
You can copy-paste the new JSON via the Web-GUI to the mi32cfg file on the ESP32 or save it elsewhere. For adding more sensors, repeat the whole procedure after refreshing the site (after saving your data!!).

## Commands

Command|Parameters
:---|:---
MI32Cfg<a id="mi32cfg"></a>|Saves current sensor list as **mi32cfg** file to the flash of the ESP32. After reboot only the saved drivers will be observed, no unknown drivers will be added. A valid config file is mandatory for HomeKit in this driver.
MI32Key<a id="mi32key"></a>| Set a "bind_key" for a MAC-address to decrypt sensor data (LYWSD03MMC, MJYD2S). The argument is a 44 uppercase characters long string, which is the concatenation of the bind_key and the corresponding MAC.<BR>`<00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF>` (32 characters) = bind_key<BR>`<112233445566>` (12 characters) = MAC of the sensor<BR>`<00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566>` (44 characters)= final string
MI32Name<a id="mi32name"></a>| Override the name of the sensor with `mi32name<slot> <name>`. Slot is the position of the sensor in the internal array (like in the payload from `status 8`), starting with 0. Will not append the OUI of the MAC to the name in the MQTT payload. Should be made persistent using command `mi32cfg`. `mi32name<slot>` will delete the override at runtime, but not change the config file.
MI32Option0<a id="mi32option"></a>|`0` = sends only recently received sensor data<br>`1` = aggregates all recent sensors data types
MI32Option1|`0` = shows full sensor data at Teleperiod<br>`1` = shows no sensor data at Teleperiod
MI32Option2|`0` = sensor data only at Teleperiod (_default_)<br>`1` = direct bridging of BLE data to MQTT messages

!!! tip

    If you really want to read battery for LYWSD02, Flora and CGD1, consider doing it in Berry.


!!! tip

    If you want to add a new BLE sensor to your config on the device, use `MI32option3 1` to add the new sensor by catching a BLE packet. Then use `MI32Cfg` to save the new config to the file system.
    To support unknown sensor types give them a suitable name with `mi32name<slot> <name>`, then save with `mi32cfg`. The system will learn about the sensors feature set by receiving data packets. The feature set can be saved too with `mi32cfg` in order to have knowledge about it at boot time.


## Mi Dashboard

The driver provides an extended web GUI to show the observed Xiaomi sensors in a widget style, that features a responsive design to use the screen area as effective as possible. The other advantage is, that only the widget with new data gets redrawn (indicated by a fading circle) and no unnecessary refresh operations will happen. A simple graph shows if valid data for every hour was received in the last 24h, where only one gap for the coming hour is not a sign of an error. Configured sensors with no received packet since boot or key/decryption errors are dimmed.
Own widgets can be added with Berry using the `MI32` module, thus allowing to create small Apps or visualizing the state of arbitrary BLE devices.


##  Homeassistant and Tasmota - BLE sensors

After creating a valid configuration with a `mi32cfg` file in the local file system, it is possible to announce all sensors to Homeassistant via MQTT discovery by using a Berry script. This will parse the `mi32cfg` file and create all needed entities for Homassistant by publishing specific messages to Homeassistant.
It will not generate duplicated sensors, but instead allows to use multiple ESP's as data sources for the same BLE sensor.
The best way is to not fiddle around with the default Tasmota configuration, especially not to change the default topic name, because this will lose the ability to automatically configure everything.

One way to use it, is to save the following script [disco.be](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Staars/berry-examples/main/disco.be) to the filesystem of the ESP and the launch it at the startup.
Create `autoexec.bat` if not already present and add the following line:
`br load("disco")`
This will create and/or init entities for every sensor and group them as a single device for every BLE device in Homeassistants MQTT integration.

In the diagnostic panel of every sensor you will see the signal strength of the BLE sensor in relation to the observing ESP, so the value will very likely differ between multiple of these BLE-ESP32-combinations.
A virtual Tasmota BLE Hub device is created, that shows all contributing ESP32 nodes for a better overview.

For sensors like humidity or temperature it should not matter, how many ESP's do contribute data. For buttons of a remote control or binary sensors like motion, this could have side effects, as multiple events will be generated (in a very short time frame). The dimmer of the YLKG08 is special case, as the data of the BLE sensor are relative steps, that are combined to a so called `number`entity with a range of  0 - 100. That way multiple messages from many ESP's will add up and "accelerate" the dimmer knob.
!!! tip

    Use the embedded [MI32CFG Importer](#mi32cfg-importer-web-app) on this site to delete unwanted sensors and then save the result to the ESP32 of your choice.


## Berry support

The driver provides two Berry modules to allow extensions and interactions with the sensors. It is also possible to write generic BLE functions unrelated to Xiaomi sensors.

What can be done?

|    Example      |                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
|Improv Wi-Fi | use Bluetooth Low-Energy for Wi-Fi commissioning of your ESP32 device|
|iBeacon      | create your own beacon, that can be tracked|
|BTHome       | build your own BLE sensor, that sends data via BLE advertisements|
|BLE lights   | control lights that uses smartphone apps like *Happy Lighting*, *Triones*, *ILC*, ...|
|BLE remotes  | use a cheap BLE remote control like the BPR2S Air Mouse|
|BLE UART     | control Tasmota without WiFi via Nordic UART Service (NUS) |
|Tuya BLE     | Control Tuya Bluetooth devices like the Fingerbot |


### MI32 module
This module allows access and modification of the internal data backend of the MI32 driver for the observed Xiaomi sensors.
First we need to import the module:
`import MI32`

MI32 method|Parameters and details
:---|:---
MI32.devices|`()` returns the number of monitored Xiaomi devices
MI32.get_name|`(x)` returns a string with the sensor name (internal name of the driver) at slot x in the internal sensor array of the driver
MI32.get_MAC|`(x)` returns a byte buffer (6 bytes) representing the MAC at slot x in the internal sensor array of the driver
MI32.set_bat|`(x,v)`  sets the battery value to v at slot x in the internal sensor array of the driver
MI32.set_hum|`(x,v)`  sets the humidity value to v at slot x in the internal sensor array of the driver
MI32.set_temp|`(x,v)`  sets the temperature value to v at slot x in the internal sensor array of the driver
MI32.widget|`(html:string[,cb:function])`  send a custom widget to the dashboard expecting a string with minimal content of `<div class="box" id="myID">hello world!</div>`, optionally get notified with a callback function for a complex UI

### BLE module

For generic BLE access we import the module:
`import BLE`

BLE Function|Parameters and details
:---|:---
adv_cb|`(callback function:function, buffer:bytes)`<br>Will start listening to advertisements or stop it by providing `nil` as function.<br>The callback function will have arguments `service data` and `manufacturer data` as integer values, that are indices pointing to these kinds of data in the buffer or have a value of 0 if there is no such data in the advertisement.
adv_watch|`(MAC:bytes[, type:int])`<br>Watch BLE address exclusively, is added to a list (MAC is a 6-byte-buffer, type is optional 0-3, default is 0).
adv_block|`(MAC:bytes[, type:int])`<br>Block BLE address, is added to a list (MAC is a 6-byte-buffer, type is optional 0-3, default is 0).
conn_cb|`(callback function:function, buffer:bytes)`<br>Will init Tasmota as a peripheral device, that can connect to a central device.<br>The callback function will have arguments `error`,`op code`,`16-bit uuid` and `handle`. If an UUID with more than 16 bit is accessed, the automatic conversion to 16-bit will probably give no usable result, thus the handle should be used in these cases.
serv_cb|`(callback function:function, buffer:bytes)`<br>Will init Tasmota as a central device (aka server) or stop it by providing `nil` as function.<br>The callback function will have arguments `error`,`op code`,`16-bit uuid` and `handle`. If an UUID with more than 16 bit is accessed, the automatic conversion to 16-bit will probably give no usable result, thus the handle should be used in these cases.
set_MAC|`(MAC:bytes[, type:int]) -> handled:bool`<br>Set MAC for for use as peripheral or central device as a 6-byte-buffer, type is optional 0-3, default is 0.
set_svc|`(UUID:string[, discoverAttributes:bool]) -> handled:bool`<br>Set service UUID for for use as peripheral or central device as a 16-Bit or 128-Bit service uuid, the latter must include the dashes. Optional: Let the BLE stack discover all attributes of the service, which takes time and battery. Default is `false`.
set_chr|`(UUID:string) -> handled:bool`<br>Set characteristic UUID for for use as peripheral or central device as a 16-Bit or 128-Bit service uuid, the latter must include the dashes.
run|`(operation:int[, response:bool, optional_arg: int])`<br>Start a Bluetooth operation, where `operation` is a proprietary code - see sections below. `Response` is optional and defaults to `false`. `optional_arg` depends on used operation, no default.
loop|`()`<br>Triggers a synchronization between Bluetooth stack and Berry, thus firing callbacks, if there is new data. Will typically be called from Berrys [Fast Loop](Berry.md#fast-loop).


To simplify BLE access this works in the form of state machine, where you have to set some properties of a context and then finally launch an operation. Besides we have three callback mechanisms for listening to advertisements, active sensor connections with Tasmota as a client and providing a server including advertising. All you need is a byte buffer in Berry for data exchange and a Berry function as the callback.
The byte buffer is always organized in the format `length-data bytes`, where the first byte represents the length of the following data bytes, which results in a maximum of 255 data bytes.
Because Bluetooth is inherently very asynchronous, almost every status, result or error condition is reported via callbacks.

    Bluetooth-Task->>Context: finish requested job, update context
    Context->>Berry: callback function
```


#### Observer (aka Advertisement listener)
To listen to advertisements inside a class (that could be a driver) we could initialize like that:

!!! example "Simple Advertisement Listener"

    ```berry
    class LISTENER
        var buf # transfer buffer, gets filled by the Bluetooth driver, can be read in Berry
        def init()
            import BLE
            self.buf = bytes(-64) # will be used in the form length-data, so self.buf[0] = length of actual data
            var callback_pointer = cb.gen_cb(/svc,manu->self.cb(svc,manu))
            BLE.adv_cb(callback_pointer,self.buf)
        end
        def cb(svc,manu)
            print("Full buffer:")
            print(self.buf[1..self.buf[0]])
            if svc != 0 # if service data present
                print("service data:")
                var _len = self.buf[svc-2]-1
                # the index points to the data part of an AD element, two position before that is length of "type + data",
                # so we subtract one byte from that length to get the "pure" data length
                print(self.buf[svc.._len+svc])
            end
            if manu != 0 # if manufacturer data present
                print("manufacturer data:")
                var _len = self.buf[manu-2]-1
                print(self.buf[manu.._len+manu])
            end
        end
    end

    return LISTENER()
    ```

To stop listening call:
`BLE.adv_cb(nil)`

We just have to provide a pointer to a (callback) function and a byte buffer.  The returned data in the byte buffer uses the following proprietary format:
```haskell
6 bytes - MAC
1 byte - address type
1 byte  - RSSI
1 byte  - length of payload
n bytes - payload data
```
```mermaid
packet-beta
0-5: "MAC"
6: "t"
7: "R"
8: "l"
9-40: "payload data (up to 31 byte)"
41-71: "optional scan response (up to 31 byte)"
```

The advertisement callback function provides 2 arguments, which are indices of the whole buffer that point to optional parts of the payload. A value of 0 means, this type of of element is not in the payload.
1. svc (= service data index) - index of service data in the advertisement buffer
2. manu (= manufacturer data index) - index of manufacturer data in the advertisement buffer

The payload is always provided completely, so every possibles AD type can be parsed in Berry if needed, but for convenience the two most important types for IOT applications are given in the callback.

!!! tip

    The payload can be parsed according to the BLE GAP standard. It consists of AD elements of variable size in the format length-type-data, where the length byte describes the length of the two following components in bytes, the type byte is defined in the GAP and the data part of 'length-1' bytes is interpreted according to the type.


!!! tip

    The watchlist is more effective to avoid missing packets than the blocklist in environments with high BLE traffic. Both methods work for the internal Xiaomi driver and the post processing with Berry, because they set properties of the underlying Bluetooth framework.

#### Peripheral role (aka client)

Communicating via connections is a bit more complex. We have to start with a callback function and a byte buffer again.
```berry
# simple example for the Berry console
import BLE
cbuf = bytes(-64)

def cb(error,op,uuid,handle)
end

cbp = tasmota.gen_cb(/e,o,u,h->cb)
BLE.conn_cb(cbp,cbuf)
```

```mermaid
---
title: "Return values of the callback function"
---
classDiagram
class cb{
    <<function>>
    error, operation, uuid, handle
}
class error{
    <<int>>
    0 - no error
    1 - connection error
    2 - did disconnect
    3 - did not get service
    4 - did not get characteristic
    5 - could not read value
    6 - characteristic can not notify
    7 - characteristic not writable
    8 - did not write value
    9 - timeout: did not read on notify
}
class operation{
    <<int>>
    1   - read
    2   - write
    3   - subscribe - response to command to subscribe, not a notification
    5   - disconnect
    6   - retrieve all services of connected device
    7   - retrieve all characteristics and GATT Characteristic Property Flags  of a service
    103 - notify read - the notification with data from the BLE server
}
class uuid{
    <<int>>
    16-bit uuid
}
class handle{
    <<int>>
    16-bit handle
}
cb --|> error
cb --|> operation
cb --|> uuid
cb --|> handle
```

Internally this creates a context, that can be modified with the following methods:

Set the MAC of the device we want to connect to:
`BLE.set_MAC(MAC,type)`: where MAC is a 6-byte-buffer, type is optional 0-3, default is 0

Set service and characteristic:
`BLE.set_svc(string)`: where string is a 16-Bit, 32-Bit or 128-Bit service uuid
`BLE.set_chr(string)`: where string is a 16-Bit, 32-Bit or 128-Bit characteristic uuid

Finally run the context with the specified properties and (if you want to get data back to Berry) have everything prepared in the callback function:
`BLE.run(operation,response)`: where operation is a number (optional: boolean w/o server response to write or subscribe, default is false) , that represents an operation in a proprietary format. Values below 10 will not disconnect automatically after completion:

- 1 - read
- 2 - write
- 3 - subscribe
- 5 - disconnect
- 6 - get all services
- 7 - get all characteristics

- 11 - read - then disconnect (returns 1 in the callback)
- 12 - write - then disconnect (returns 2 in the callback)
- 13 - subscribe - then disconnect after waiting for notification (returns 3 in the callback)

The buffer format for reading and writing is in the format (length - data):
```
1 byte  - length of data in bytes
n bytes - data
```

#### Central role (aka server)

The server is initiated similarly with `BLE.serv_cb(cbp,cbuf)`.
After that you have to construct the server by first adding all *characteristics* and finally starting it, by setting the *advertisement* data for the first time.
Setting *advertisement* data without adding *characteristics* will not start a BLE server but only a BLE Broadcaster, which is totally fine for some use cases (i.e. Beacons, BTHome).
The BLE server can be stopped with `BLE.serv_cb(nil)`, which will restart the "BLE Scan Task".

The callback functions returns error, operation, 16-bit-uuid and 16-bit-handle.

```berry
# simple server setup example for the Berry console
import BLE
cbuf = bytes(-256)

def cb(error,op,uuid,handle)
end

cbp = tasmota.gen_cb(cb)
BLE.serv_cb(cbp,cbuf)
# now add characteristics and advertisement ...
```

####Command op codes:

- 201 - add and/or set advertisement data according to the BLE standard, typically chaining small packets in the in the format of `length-type-data`.
When called for the first time, will return a bytes buffer, that represents an array of the 16-bit-handles of all characteristics in the order of addition.
- 202 - add and/or set scan response data, according to the BLE standard which is equally  to the advertisement data. Should be used sparsely.
- 211 - add and/or set characteristic with value of bytes buffer. 
For simplicity a `Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor` (aka 0x2902) will be added on construction of every characteristic and read, write, notification and indication is enabled.
You can select write with or without response withe the optional boolean of  `BLE.set_chr(string, bool)`, which defaults to "write with no response".
The function call will always trigger a *callback*. As every *characteristic* belongs to a *service*, `BLE.set_svc(string)` must have been called before.

####Response op codes (triggered when a client interacts with the server):

- 221 - on read of a characteristic, returns no buffer data
- 222 - on write of a characteristic, returns the written values as byte buffer data
- 223 - on unsubscribe, returns no buffer data
- 224 - on subscribe to notifications, returns no buffer data
- 225 - on subscribe to indications, returns no buffer data
- 226 - on subscribe to notifications and indications, returns no buffer data
- 227 - on connect, returns MAC of client device as byte buffer
- 228 - on disconnect, returns no buffer data
- 229 - on status, returns error code as byte buffer
- 230 - on authentication, returns raw security record as byte buffer

!!! tip

    By default the synchronization between the BLE framework and Berry happens every 50 milliseconds, which should be enough for the majority of use cases.
    For very fast BLE devices it can be necessary to use Berrys `fast_loop` to trigger this at maximum speed (of about every 5 milliseconds).
    This is typically done in an init function of a class like that:
    `tasmota.add_fast_loop(/-> BLE.loop())`

####Configuration op codes (return immediately, no callback involved):

- 231 - set own address to random with `BLE.set_MAC(bytes("aabbccddeeff"),1)`
- 232 - set advertising parameters with bytes() descriptor of length 5 [advType:byte, minInterval:uint16_t, max interval: uint16_t]
- 233 - set GAP name with `string` in bytes buffer (must be null terminated)

### Berry examples

    cbuf = bytes(-64)
    def cb()

        if j == 0

        end
        if j == 1
            var temp = cbuf.get(1,2)/100.0
            var hum = cbuf.get(3,1)*1.0
            var bat = (cbuf.get(4,2)-2100)/12
            MI32.set_temp(sl,temp)
            MI32.set_hum(sl,hum)
