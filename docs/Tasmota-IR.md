The default Tasmota firmware variants include support for IR send/receive for a limited set of protocols (see [IR Remote](Commands#ir-remote)). 

Tasmota uses the [IRremoteESP8266 library](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266) that supports numerous protocols. Each protocol consumes some memory, especially air conditioner protocols (up to 81k of flash size). Also, every protocol included increases the time to decode the IR signal. 

There are two additional Tasmota firmware variants that provide almost all IRremoteESP8266 protocols. This requires disabling some other features to keep code size manageable.

- `tasmota-ir` is pre-packaged for IR bridge devices such as [Automate Things IRBR](https://templates.blakadder.com/automate_things_AT-IRBR_v14.html), [Eachen](https://templates.blakadder.com/eachen-IR-DC6.html) or [YTF](https://templates.blakadder.com/ytf_ir_bridge.html). Choose `tasmota-ir` if you are using an IR blaster. 
- `tasmota-ircustom` is used if you want to customize your features (additional sensors, language, etc.). See [compile your own firmware](Compile-your-build).

You can [flash](Getting-Started#flashing) the binary or [upgrade](Upgrading) your existing one.

To test that you have the correct firmware on your device  issue the following command in the web UI Console: 

`IRHVAC {"Vendor":"xx"}`

The output should be a list of the supported protocols/vendors. For example:  
```
RESULT = {"IRHVAC":"Wrong Vendor (COOLIX|DAIKIN|KELVINATOR|MITSUBISHI_AC|GREE|ARGO|TROTEC|TOSHIBA_AC|FUJITSU_AC|MIDEA|HAIER_AC|HITACHI_AC|HAIER_AC_YRW02|WHIRLPOOL_AC|SAMSUNG_AC|ELECTRA_AC|PANASONIC_AC|DAIKIN2|VESTEL_AC|TECO|TCL112AC|MITSUBISHI_HEAVY_88|MITSUBISHI_HEAVY_152|DAIKIN216|SHARP_AC|GOODWEATHER|DAIKIN160|NEOCLIMA|DAIKIN176|DAIKIN128|AMCOR)"}
```

## Sending IR Commands
Send an IR remote control code as a decimal or hexadecimal string in a JSON payload. In order to send IR data, _**you must configure one of the free device GPIO as `IRSend (8)`. Neither GPIO01 nor GPIO03 can be used.**_

### Controlling ACs with toggle fields

Some ACs such as Airwell, Whirlpool and others use a differential IR protocol for some properties. If "power" is a toggle property, then value of '1' in the protocol will mean "turn off" if the AC is currently "on" and it will mean "turn on" if the AC is currently "off". This could also be the case for other properties such as "light", "swing", etc. Since Tasmota and IRRemote8266 send and receive absolute states (i.e. the HVAC JSON object has a field called 'Power' not 'PowerToggle'), some functionality was added to keep track of the predicted state of the AC. This way, if the predicted state is in-sync with the actual state, the device can transmit a correct IR packet to transition the AC from the previous state to the desired state. This logic is controlled by the `StateMode` HVAC property. If your AC IR protocol sends absolute values you can ignore this property. If your AC has a differential protocol Tasmota will be able to control the AC assuming the Tasmota IR device has at most one differential AC in IR range. If you would like to also control your AC with the physical remote your Tamsota IR device will need to have an IR receiver so that it can sync with the actual state.

If at some point the state in Tasmota and the actual state get out of sync, you can specify `StateMode=StoreOnly` to update Tasmota with the actual state. This will update state but not send an IR command.

Normally when receiving an IR command via the IR receiver the command will be processed and the state will be updated. As a result it is not needed to store state when sending as it will cause duplication and the toggle will happen twice. The most common operation mode, and default, therefore is `StateMode=SendOnly`.

If your Tasmota device does not have an IR receiver you can still control a differential AC with it by specifying `StateMode=SendStore` but you will not be able to use a physical remote without loosing sync between the actual and predicted states.

## Receiving IR Commands
If you have an IR receiver, a message will be logged each time an IR message is seen. IR driver will try to decode the message against all supported protocols. If unrecognized, the `"Protocol":"UNKNOWN"` will be shown. In this case, the `"Data"` field contains a hash of the received message. The hash can't be used to send the a message, but the same hash will be produced by the same message.  

An inexpensive IR sensor such as a [TSOP1838](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/keyes-tsop1838-infra-red-37-9khz-receiver-for-arduino.html) can be connected to a device running Tasmota. Configure a free device GPIO as 'IRrecv (51)'. When Tasmota receives an IR message, the data portion of the payload has the same format as the [`IRsend`](Commands#irsend) parameter.

```
{"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"<value>","Bits":<value>,"Data":<value>}}
```

This JSON payload data can be used in a rule such as:

```
ON IrReceived#Data=<value> DO <command> ENDON
```

If the data is received on an unknown protocol use `SetOption58 1`. See [here](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/2116#issuecomment-440716483).

Examples:  
**Pioneer Vol+**  
`MQT: tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"PIONEER","Bits":64,"Data":"0xA55A50AFA55A50AF","DataLSB":"0xA55A0AF5A55A0AF5","Repeat":0}}`

**Pioneer Vol-**  
`tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"PIONEER","Bits":64,"Data":"0xA55AD02FA55AD02F","DataLSB":"0xA55A0BF4A55A0BF4","Repeat":0}}`

Toshiba (NEC): **Channel 1**  
`MQT: tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"NEC","Bits":32,"Data":"0x02FD807F","DataLSB":"0x40BF01FE","Repeat":0}}`

Toshiba (NEC): **Channel 2**  
`MQT: tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"NEC","Bits":32,"Data":"0x02FD40BF","DataLSB":"0x40BF02FD","Repeat":0}}`

Toshiba (NEC): **Channel 3**  
`MQT: tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"NEC","Bits":32,"Data":"0x02FDC03F","DataLSB":"0x40BF03FC","Repeat":0}}`

As you can see above, `"DataLSB"` are easier to decode than `"Data"`. The third byte contains the command, and the fourth byte is the third with all bits reversed.

Example of HVAC message:  
`MQT: tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"MITSUBISHI_HEAVY_152","Bits":152,"Data":"0xAD513CE51A08F705FA02FDC03F08F700FF807F","Repeat":0,"IRHVAC":{"Vendor":"MITSUBISHI_HEAVY_152","Model":-1,"Power":"on","Mode":"auto","Celsius":"on","Temp":22,"FanSpeed":"medium","SwingV":"off","SwingH":"off","Quiet":"off","Turbo":"off","Econo":"off","Light":"off","Filter":"off","Clean":"off","Beep":"off","Sleep":-1}}}`

`MQT: tele/tasmota/IR1/RESULT = {"IrReceived":{"Protocol":"COOLIX","Bits":24,"Data":"0xB25F78","DataLSB":"0x4DFA1E","Repeat":0,"IRHVAC":{"Vendor":"COOLIX","Model":-1,"Power":"on","Mode":"auto","Celsius":"on","Temp":22,"FanSpeed":"medium","SwingV":"off","SwingH":"off","Quiet":"off","Turbo":"off","Econo":"off","Light":"on","Filter":"off","Clean":"on","Beep":"off","Sleep":-1}}}`

`RSL: RESULT = {"Time":"2019-09-09T21:52:35","IrReceived":{"Protocol":"PANASONIC_AC","Bits":216,"Data":"0x0220E004000000060220E00400032C805F06000EE0000081000089","Repeat":0,"IRHVAC":{"Vendor":"PANASONIC_AC","Model":2,"Power":"on","Mode":"auto","Celsius":"on","Temp":22,"FanSpeed":"medium","SwingV":"auto","SwingH":"middle","Quiet":"off","Turbo":"off","Econo":"off","Light":"off","Filter":"off","Clean":"off","Beep":"off","Sleep":-1}}}`
