PIR motion sensors, albeit called sensors, are configured as switches in Tasmota since they basically report _motion_ (`1`) or _no motion_ (`0`) to the device. 

Most PIR's are single wire and they require connecting to VCC, GND and one GPIO. In this guide we will use `GPIO13` as the pin that the PIR output is connected to. See [PIN Restrictions](Peripherals.md#restrictions) on which pins not to use.

In the simple case of wanting PIR activity to turn on a light/fan connected to the same device, you can use `SwitchMode 13` (push to on), along with a `PulseTime` for the minimum on-period. Then you can skip the more detailed options on this page.

### Tasmota Settings for Rules
In **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** menu change `GPIO13` to `Switch1`.
![Step 1](_media/GPIO13-switch.png)

If there already is a `Switch1` simply choose the next in line. Same applies if you're connecting more than 1 PIR on a single device.

A configured PIR will not appear in the web UI in any form. To make it report like a sensor we need a rule that will send movement triggers to an MQTT topic.

```console
SwitchMode1 1
SwitchTopic 0
Rule1 on Switch1#state=1 do publish stat/%topic%/PIR1 ON endon on Switch1#state=0 do Publish stat/%topic%/PIR1 OFF endon
Rule1 1
```
You can change (`PIR1`) and the message (`ON`/`OFF`) to whatever suits your needs. `%topic%` is the configured device topic.

Look in console for motion detection messages ```[20:24:03] stat/%topic%/PIR1 ON``` to verify everything is working

_optional:_
Before using rules configure any GPIO that doesn't have anything connected to it as `Relay1`.    
This creates a dummy relay which is triggered by the PIR so you can see the changes in the web UI. This method is not recommended for daily use and should only be used for testing.

A more [advanced example](Rules#auto-off-motion-sense-switch) of rules with PIRs.

### Tasmota Settings for HomeAssistant Autodiscovery

Alternatively, a PIR motion sensor can be configured as a switch with its state reported for autodiscovery by HomeAssistant.

[Detach switches from relays](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#setoption114) and send MQTT messages instead:

```console
SetOption114 1
```

To have switches discovered SwitchTopic must be set to a custom name. And the [switch mode](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchmode) should be set to follow.

```console
SwitchTopic1 pir
SwitchMode1 1
```

After this, the PIR sensor "switch" will be autodiscovered in Home Assistant as a sensor.

## AM312 

[AM312](http://www.image.micros.com.pl/_dane_techniczne_auto/cz%20am312.pdf) works even on 3.3v instead of 5v (like HC-SR501) which makes it perfect for ESP8266 devices without a 5V line (like Sonoff Basic). It is also less prone to false triggers due to Wi-Fi interference.

### Pinout
![AM312 Pinout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/67886972-b7b8bd00-fb4a-11e9-90ea-93fd7f5ec972.png)

Pin marked VOUT is connected to a free GPIO pin on the device.


This PIR goes to off state after a few seconds so we need to use this rule *instead* of the one in the example. 
```console
Rule1 on Switch1#state=1 do Backlog Publish stat/%topic%/PIR1 ON; RuleTimer1 30 endon on Rules#Timer=1 do Publish stat/%topic%/PIR1 OFF endon
```
With this it will stay ON for 30 seconds then send OFF message and the timer restarts every time there's an ON trigger.

Another configuration option is to change Switchmode to 14 with Pulsetime of 130 (30 seconds on every time the AM312 is triggered)

Another use case as a [hand wave switch](Project-AM312-and-Sonoff-R2).

## HC-SR501

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/67890781-a32bf300-fb51-11e9-8f84-1413fccc4e78.png" width=200>

Configuration with HC-SR501 is easiest with Switchmode 1, since this module has a built-in trigger/delay potentiometers and the state remains ON during the trigger period.

## MH-SR602
This is a very small version of a PIR that is able to modify the sensitivity and delay by soldering resistors.


With factory settings this PIR goes to off state after a few seconds so we need to use this rule *instead* of the one in the example. 
```console
Rule1 on Switch1#state=1 do Backlog Publish stat/%topic%/PIR1 ON; RuleTimer1 30 endon on Rules#Timer=1 do Publish stat/%topic%/PIR1 OFF endon
```
With this it will stay ON for 30 seconds then send OFF message and the timer restarts every time there's an ON trigger.

## Panasonic EKMC1603111

Set the data pin to `Switch n` for it to work.

## Configuring Tasmota to for Home Assistant

To make Home Assistant recognize your PIR sensor automatically, skip all previous steps, and execute
the following steps to make Tasmota announce your PIR as a motion sensor.

1. In **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** menu change your GPIO pin to `Switch2` (or any other switch number).
2. Assuming you picked `Switch2` in the previous step, run this command:

```console
Backlog rule1 on switch2#state do publish stat/%topic%/MOTION %value% endon; rule1 1; switchmode2 1, so19 1
```

3. Run this very-long command all at once:

```console
rule2 on system#boot do publish2 homeassistant/%topic%/config {
  "name": "Motion Sensor",
  "state_topic": "stat/%topic%/MOTION",
  "payload_on": 1,
  "availability_topic": "tele/%topic%/LWT",
  "payload_available": "Online",
  "payload_not_available": "Offline",
  "device_class": "motion",
  "force_update": true,
  "off_delay": 30,
  "unique_id": "%deviceid%_motion",
  "device": {
    "identifiers": [
      "%deviceid%"
    ]
  }
} endon
```

4. Run the following two commands to enable the rule, and then restart the device:

```console
Rule2 1
Restart 1
```

Note that this configuration, much like the rest of the examples on this page, don't show the PIR sensor's state on the home screen of Tasmota.
