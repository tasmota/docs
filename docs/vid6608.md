# VID6608 Automotive gauge driver

??? failure "This feature is not included in precompiled binaries"  

    When [compiling your build](Compile-your-build) add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
    ```arduino
    #ifndef USE_VID6608
    #//#define USE_VID6608 // Add support for VID6608 Automotive analog gauge driver (+0k7 code)
    #endif
    ```

This driver implements support for following driver chips for analog automotive gauges (Switec X25.168, X27.168 and clones) with microstepping support:

* VID6606 (2 motors)
* VID6608 (4 motors)
* VT6608S
* AX1201728SG
* BY8920
* many others

Driver chips with microstepping is the recommended way to drive such motors, they provide much more relailabe and smooth movement with reduced noise and to avoid skipping steps.

Driver is configured to perform 320° rotation angle with 12 steps per degree. Total capacity is 3840 steps for whole scale. Driver supports up to 4 motors.

## Features

## Configuration

IC driver requires only 2 pins to drive single motor, similar to other stepper drivers: one is for step and one for direction. Configuration example from Datasheet:

See full description and recommendations: [VID6608 Datasheet (EN)](_media/vid6608/VID6608.pdf).

### Wiring

| VID6608 | ESP |
|---------|-----|
| VCC     | 5V  
| GND     | GND   
| f(scx)  | GPIOx
| CW      | GPIOy

Example wiring:

### Tasmota Settings 

In the **_Configuration -> Configure Module_** page assign:

1. GPIOx to `VID6608 F`
2. GPIOy to `VID6608 CW`

After a reboot the driver should detect the motor and:

* Issue homing operation at startup;
* Display "Gauge X" information on web page;

## ESP8266 notes

With ESP8266 driver also works, but gauge movement is _much_ slower (~2 sec per degree).
