!!! info "MQTT is the main protocol for controlling Tasmota devices"

After you have a working [MQTT broker](https://www.google.com/search?q=setting+up+an+mqtt+broker) you need to configure Tasmota to communicate with it. 
If you have no knowledge of what MQTT is, you can learn about it from [MQTT Essentials](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials/) articles. 

## Configure MQTT 
If you flashed a precompiled .bin or didn't enter MQTT info in `user_config_override.h` before compiling you have to configure it on your device first.

### Configure MQTT using WebUI
Go to **Configuration -> Configure Other** and make sure **"MQTT Enable"** box is checked.<BR> 
Once MQTT is enabled you need to set it up using **Configuration -> Configure MQTT**. 

!!! tip
    While here, you might as well change the Friendly Name into something more descriptive than generic "Tasmota".<br>*This is a must for Home Assistant autodiscovery feature.*

For a basic setup you only need to set **Host**, **User** and **Password** but it is recommended to change **Topic** to avoid issues. Each device should have a unique **Topic**.

- **Host** = your MQTT broker address or IP (**mDNS is not available in the official Tasmota builds**, means no `.local` domain!) 
- **Port** = your MQTT broker port (default port is set to 1883)
- **Client** = device's unique identifier. In 99% of cases it's okay to leave it as is, however some Cloud-based MQTT brokers require a ClientID connected to your account.  **Can not be identical to Topic!**
- **User** = username for authenticating on your MQTT broker
- **Password** = password for authenticating on your MQTT broker
- **Topic** = unique identifying topic for your device (e.g. `hallswitch`, `kitchen-light`). `%topic%` in wiki references to this. **It is recommended to use a single word for the topic.**
- **FullTopic** = [full topic definition](#mqtt-topic-definition). Modify it if you want to use multi-level topics for your devices, for example `lights/%prefix%/%topic%/` or `%prefix%/top_floor/bathroom/%topic%/` etc.

### Configure MQTT using Backlog

Using a serial connection or the WebUI Console you can issue (or even better, paste a premade) Backlog command for quick and easy MQTT setup.

```haskell
Backlog mqtthost <mqtt_broker_address>; mqttport <mqtt_broker_port>; mqttuser <username>; mqttpassword <password>; topic <device_topic>
```

After a reboot all necessary MQTT settings are configured. Don't forget, you can use Backlog for all commands!

## Commands over MQTT
To send commands and view responses you'll need an [MQTT client](http://www.hivemq.com/blog/seven-best-mqtt-client-tools).

Commands over MQTT are issued to Tasmota by using topic `cmnd/%topic%/<command>` and payload `<parameter>`. If there is no `<parameter>` (an empty MQTT message/payload), a query is sent for current status of the `<command>`.

!!! tip
    If you are using *mosquitto_pub*, you can issue an empty payload using the `-n` command line option. 
    If your MQTT client cannot issue an empty payload, you can use the single character `?` instead.

### Command flow

The following example will go in depth on what happens when you send an MQTT command.

A device was flashed and configured with the **FullTopic** as default `%prefix%/%topic%/` and the **Topic** set to `tasmota_switch`. We want to see the current status of the switch and change it.

By looking at the commands table we can learn about the [`POWER`](Commands.md#power) command and options associated with it. 

#### Ask the device for status

```js
cmnd/tasmota_switch/Power ← 	// an empty message/payload sends a status query
    ↳ stat/tasmota_switch/RESULT → {"POWER":"OFF"}  
    ↳ stat/tasmota_switch/POWER → OFF
```
  We can see that the switch (device's relay) is turned off.

####Send a command to toggle the relay

```js
cmnd/tasmota_switch/Power TOGGLE
    ↳ // Power for relay 1 is toggled
    ↳ stat/tasmota_switch/RESULT → {"POWER":"ON"}  
    ↳ stat/tasmota_switch/POWER → ON
```
  We've sent the toggle command and received confirmation that the switch is turned on.

!!! tip
    By default, Tasmota replies to all commands through `.../RESULT`.
    This behavior can be changed using [SetOption4](Commands.md#setoption4), which makes the commands reply on the endpoint matching the command name, ex. `cmnd/tasmota/PowerOnState` will send a response on `stat/tasmota/POWERONSTATE`.

### Examples
In the following examples `%topic%` is `tasmota`, FullTopic is `%prefix%/%topic%/`, and prefixes are default `cmnd/stat/tele`:

- The relay can be controlled with `cmnd/tasmota/POWER on`, `cmnd/tasmota/POWER off` or `cmnd/tasmota/POWER toggle`. Tasmota will send a MQTT status message like `stat/tasmota/POWER ON`.

- Power state message can be sent with the retain flag set using [`PowerRetain 1`](Commands#powerretain).

- Telemetry messages can also be sent with the retain flag using [`SensorRetain`](Commands#sensorretain).

- For Sonoff Dual or Sonoff 4CH the relays need to be addressed with `cmnd/tasmota/POWER<x>`, where {x} is the relay number from 1 to 2 (Sonoff Dual) or from 1 to 4 (Sonoff 4CH). `cmnd/tasmota/POWER4 off` turns off the 4th relay on a Sonoff 4CH.

- MQTT topic can be changed with `cmnd/tasmota/Topic tasmota1` which reboots Tasmota and changes the `%topic%` to `tasmota1`. From that point on MQTT commands should look like `cmnd/tasmota1/POWER on`.

- The OTA firmware location can be made known to tasmota with `cmnd/tasmota/OtaUrl http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota.bin`. Reset to default with `cmnd/tasmota/OtaUrl 1`.

- Upgrade OTA firmware from the OtaUrl server with `cmnd/tasmota/Upgrade 1`.

- Show all status information with `cmnd/tasmota/Status 0`.

- The button can send a MQTT message to the broker that in turn will switch the relay. To configure this you need to perform `cmnd/tasmota/ButtonTopic tasmota` where tasmota equals to Topic. The message can also be provided with the retain flag by `cmnd/tasmota/ButtonRetain on`.

- Sonoff Pow (and any device with sensors) status can be requested manually with `cmnd/tasmota/status 8`. Additionally, Tasmota periodically sends telemetry every [TelePeriod](Commands.md#teleperiod), which defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes).

- When a Sonoff Pow (and any device with power metering sensors) threshold like PowerLow has been met a message `tele/tasmota/POWER_LOW ON` will be sent. When the error is corrected a message `tele/tasmota/POWER_LOW OFF` will be sent.

While most MQTT commands will result in a message in JSON format the power status feedback will always be returned like `stat/tasmota/POWER ON` as well.

Telemetry data will be sent by prefix `tele` like `tele/tasmota/SENSOR {"Time":"2017-02-16T10:13:52", "DS18B20":{"Temperature":20.6}}`

## MQTT Topic Definition

### FullTopic
This is the MQTT topic used to communicate with Tasmota over MQTT. It is created using tokens placed within a user definable string (100 character limit). The tokens are substituted dynamically at run-time. Available substitution tokens are:

- `%prefix%` = one of three prefixes as defined by commands `Prefix1` *(default = `cmnd`)*, `Prefix2` *(default = `stat`)* and `Prefix3` *(default = `tele`)*.
- `%topic%` = one of five topics as defined by commands [`Topic`](Commands.md#topic), [`GroupTopic`](Commands.md#grouptopic), [`ButtonTopic`](Commands.md#buttontopic), [`SwitchTopic`](Commands.md#switchtopic) and [`MqttClient`](Commands.md#mqttclient).
- `%hostname%` = the hostname of the device as defined through the web UI *(default = `%s-%04d`)* or via [`Hostname`](Commands.md#hostname) command.
- `%id%` =  MAC address of the device.

!!! tip
    These substitution tokens will be used in examples across the documentation

If `FullTopic` does not contain the `%topic%` token, the device will not subscribe to `GroupTopic` and `FallbackTopic`.

!!! tip
    The order of _%prefix%_ and _%topic%_ doesn't matter, unless you have enabled Auto-discovery for Home Assistant ([`SetOption19`](Commands.md#setoption19)). Enabling this option re-formats the FullTopic to required order.

Using the tokens the following example topics can be made:

- `FullTopic %prefix%/%topic%/` _default_
- `FullTopic tasmota/%topic%/%prefix%/`
- `FullTopic tasmota/bedroom/%topic%/%prefix%/`
- `FullTopic penthouse/bedroom1/bathroom2/%topic%/%prefix%/`
- `FullTopic %prefix%/home/cellar/%topic%/`

#### %prefix%
Tasmota uses 3 prefixes for forming a FullTopic:

- `cmnd` - prefix to issue commands; ask for status
- `stat` - reports back status or configuration message
- `tele` - reports telemetry info at specified intervals

!!! warning
    To solve possible MQTT topic loops it is strongly suggested that you use the `%prefix%` token in all of your FullTopics. Status and telemetry do not need a prefix.

### %topic%
All MQTT status messages will be sent using the configurable `%topic%` which must be made unique by the user. It can be called `bedroom` but it could also be called `XP-TS_10` as long as the user knows what it is and where to find it.

!!! bug "Default Topic is `tasmota_XXXXXX` where `XXXXXX` is unique and derives from the last 6 characters of the MAC address"

The use of the `%topic%` token is mandatory in case you want to use [`ButtonTopic`](Commands.md#buttontopic) and/or [`SwitchTopic`](Commands.md#switchtopic). It also provides for GroupTopic and Fallback Topic functionality.

!!! tip
    Use `%prefix%` and `%topic%` tokens at all time within your FullTopic definition!

### GroupTopic
Having two devices with the same topic allowed for MQTT commands to be sent once to make the devices act in conjunction. That inspired a third topic called GroupTopic.  Devices with the same GroupTopic will all listen to that GroupTopic and react to the same MQTT command sent to it. You can use this to take global actions like updating firmware on all devices or split up devices into different groups using a unique GroupTopic for each group.

!!! bug "Default GroupTopic is `tasmotas`"

### FallBack Topic
Initially Tasmota had one MQTT configurable topic planned called Topic. It soon became apparent that when two devices come online with the same topic this would be a challenge, to say the least!

Tasmota then introduced a unique, non-configurable "FallBack Topic" that allows MQTT communication regardless of the configurable topic. This fallback topic is just what it is meant to be: **a fallback topic** in case of emergency!

By default the Fallback Topic is `DVES_XXXXXX_fb` where xxxxxx is derived from the last 6 charactes of the device's MAC address (excluding `:`). It might look something like this: `DVES_3D5E26_fb`. You can find out the DVES code by looking at **Information** page in the webUI or issuing `Status 6`:
```json
12:36:17 MQT: stat/tasmota/STATUS6 = {"StatusMQT":{"MqttHost":"1.1.1.1","MqttPort":1883,"MqttClientMask":"DVES_%06X","MqttClient":"DVES_3D5E26","MqttUser":"tasmota","MqttCount":1,"MAX_PACKET_SIZE":1000,"KEEPALIVE":30}}
```

## Retained MQTT Messages

If MQTT is defined and [`PowerRetain`](Commands.md#powerretain) is used the last state will be stored permanently in MQTT database.

|Command | Description |
|-|-|
[`PowerRetain`](Commands.md#powerretain)	| Show current MQTT power retain state.<BR> `0` / `off` = disable MQTT power retain on status update *(default)* <BR> `1` / `on` = enable MQTT power retain on status update

**BUT**, a message in your MQTT broker flagged as 'retained' will **_always_ override the `PowerOnState`**. 

This is usually the main cause for "ghost switching". Learn more in [MQTT retained messages explained](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt-retained-messages-example/). Check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31IyfM1gygo) for troubleshooting switch ghosting.

### Clearing Retained Messages
To check, if there is a retain flag set for the switch's power topic, monitor `cmnd/+/power` in a MQTT client (recommended [MQTT.fx](https://mqttfx.jensd.de/) for Windows or [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) in linux).

You can use [Tasmota Device Manager](https://github.com/jziolkowski/tdm) to clear all retained messages for selected device with a single click.

## Return codes (rc)

Sometimes, something wrong can happen and you might need to check return codes.

A return code can be found in the console, example output for Return Code = `5` : `MQT: Connect failed to xxxx:1883, rc 5. Retry in 10 sec`

Below table provides more information about it. The original values are related to [PubSubClient.h constants](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html#state).

|Code |Constant name |Description |
|-|-|-|
|-4|MQTT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT|the server didn't respond within the keepalive time|
|-3|MQTT_CONNECTION_LOST|the network connection was broken|
|-2|MQTT_CONNECT_FAILED|the network connection failed|
|-1|MQTT_DISCONNECTED|the client is disconnected cleanly|
|0|MQTT_CONNECTED|the client is connected|
|1|MQTT_CONNECT_BAD_PROTOCOL|the server doesn't support the requested version of MQTT|
|2|MQTT_CONNECT_BAD_CLIENT_ID|the server rejected the client identifier|
|3|MQTT_CONNECT_UNAVAILABLE|the server was unable to accept the connection|
|4|MQTT_CONNECT_BAD_CREDENTIALS|the username/password were rejected|
|5|MQTT_CONNECT_UNAUTHORIZED|the client was not authorized to connect|
