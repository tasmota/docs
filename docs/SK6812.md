!!! failure "This feature is not included in precompiled binaries"
    
To use it you must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
```
  #define USE_WS2812_HARDWARE  NEO_HW_SK6812     
  #define USE_WS2812_CTYPE     NEO_GRBW           // Color type (NEO_RGB, NEO_GRB, NEO_BRG, NEO_RBG, NEO_RGBW, NEO_GRBW)
```

Wiring with a level shifter is required. Look at [WS2812B LEDs](WS2812B-and-WS2813.md) article for instructions.

### Tasmota Settings
In the *Configuration -> Configure Module* page, select the following:
