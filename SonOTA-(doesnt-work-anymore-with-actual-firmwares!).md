How to setup and configure SonOTA for Tasmota upload. There basically two ways to install via SonOTA:
* With compiling: You can compile the different components as intended, setting the compile flags to match your installation. This will allow to be faster at setting up lots of devices, as you will have to do less reconfiguration after Tasmota install.
* Quick and dirty (and easy): [installation from unmodified binaries](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/SonOTA---Espressif2Arduino---Tasmota-without-compiling) without needing to compile anything or install SDKs, but having to adjust a temporary wifi with some predefined credentials / SSIDs - see the [SonOTA](https://github.com/mirko/SonOTA) for more information.
