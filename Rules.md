?> Rules expand the functionality of Tasmota with flexible and user configurable logic
<a id="top"></a>

Tasmota provides a Rule feature heavily inspired by the _ESPEasy_ implementation while maintaining a small memory footprint. Automation solutions can be implemented without having to add dedicated code or use external solutions.  

Rules perform actions based on triggers (e.g., switch state change, temperature threshold, events like system boot, a defined timer elapsing, custom defined events, etc.) They are stored in flash and therefore will survive a reboot.

> [!NOTE] Most pre-compiled [builds](Builds) have the Rules feature enabled. *If you are >compiling your own firmware, in order to use rules, include `#define USE_RULES` in `user_config_override.h`.*

**Complete list of [Rules Commands](Commands#rules)**  

## Rule Syntax

Rule definition statement:  
`ON <trigger> DO <command> [ENDON | BREAK]`  
- **`ON`** - marks the beginning of a rule definition  
- **`<trigger>`** - what condition needs to occur for the rule to execute  
- **`DO`** - what <command> the rule is to perform if the `<trigger>` condition is met  
- **`ENDON`**  - marks the end of a rule. It can be followed by another rule.
- **`BREAK`**  - marks the end of a rule. `BREAK` will stop the execution of the remaining rules that follow this rule within the rule set. If a rule that ends with `BREAK` is triggered, the following rules in that rule set will not be executed. This allows the rules to somewhat simulate an "IF/ELSE" statement.  

Rule sets are defined by using the [`Rule<x>`](Commands#rule) command. After defining a rule set, you have to enable it (turn it on) using `Rule<x> 1`. Similarly you can disable the rule set using `Rule<x> 0`.  
  
There are three separate rule sets called `Rule1`, `Rule2` and `Rule3`. Each rule set can contain as many rules as can fit within the 511 character limit. Whenever a rule set is enabled all the rules in it will be active. If the character count of the rules in the set exceed the limit, split the rules into another rule set. If you have a long list of rules, verify the rules have all fit by inspecting the resulting log.

Rules inside a rule set `Rule<x>` are concatenated and entered as a single statement.  
`Rule<x> ON <trigger1> DO <command> ENDON ON <trigger2> DO <command> ENDON ...`  

Spaces after `ON`, around `DO`, and before `ENDON` or `BREAK` are mandatory. A rule is **not** case sensitive.  

### Rule Trigger
A rule trigger can consist of:  
- `[TriggerName]#[ValueName]`
- `[TriggerName]#[ValueName][comparison][value]`
- `[SensorName]#[ValueName]`
- `[SensorName]#[ValueName][comparison][value]`
- `Tele-[SensorName]#[ValueName]`

A trigger may be used in more than one rule. This may be required for some cases of using `IF/ELSE` since an `IF` statement cannot be used within a `Backlog`.

#### Rule Trigger Comparison Operators

|Operator|Function|
|:-:|:--|
|`=` | equal to (used for string comparison)|
|`==`| equal to (used for numerical comparison)|
|`>`| greater than|
|`<`| lesser than|
|`!=`| not equal to|
|`>=`| greater than or equal to|
|`<=`| lesser than or equal to|
|`\|`| used for [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) with remainder = 0 (exact division)|

#### Examples of Available Triggers

Trigger|When it occurs

Every [command](Commands) with a JSON payload response has an associated rule trigger.

|Trigger           | When it occurs |
|------------------|----------------|
|&lt;command\>#Data|A one level JSON payload such as `{"command":"value"}`. For example, for {"Fanspeed":3}, the trigger is`Fanspeed#Data`.|
|&lt;command\>#level1#level2#levelN|A multi-level level JSON payload such as `{"level1":{"level2":{"levelN":"value"}}}` does **NOT** have the `#Data` trigger. Instead, the trigger for these responses is `level1#level2#levelN`. For example, for {"PulseTime2":{"Set":0,"Remaining":0}}, the triggers are `PulseTime2#Set` and `PulseTime2#Remaining`.|

Connected sensors can be a trigger in the form as they are represented in the `TelePeriod` and `Status 8` JSON payloads.  

|Trigger           | When it occurs |
|------------------|----------------|
|DS18B20#Temperature| whenever the temperature of sensor DS18B20 changes|
|DS18B20#Temperature&lt;20| whenever the temperature of sensor DS18B20 is below 20 degrees|
|BME280#Humidity==55.5| whenever the humidity of sensor BEM280 equals 55.5%|
|INA219#Current\>0.100| whenever the current drawn is more than 0.1A|
|Energy#Power\>100| whenever the power used is more than 100W|

When the payload consists of an array of data eg: `ENERGY":{Current":[1.320,2.100]}`

|Trigger           | When it occurs |
------------------|----------------|
|Energy#Current\[N\]|N = Number of the field. 1 for the first `1.320`, 2 for the second `2.100` etc.|
|Energy#Current\[1\]\>1.000|whenever the first value of Energy#Current is higher than 1.000.|

To trigger only at TelePeriod time, prefix the sensor with the word `Tele-`.  

|Trigger           | When it occurs |
------------------|----------------|
|Tele-AM2301#Temperature|sensor AM2301 Temperature value when the TelePeriod JSON payload is output|

Hardware and software serial interface, RF, IR and TuyaMCU are also supported based on their [JSON](JSON-Status-Responses) status message:  

|Trigger           | When it occurs |
------------------|----------------|
|TuyaReceived#Data=&lt;hex_string><a id="TuyaReceivedData"></a>| whenever &lt;hex_string> is received with [TuyaMCU](TuyaMCU) component|
|SerialReceived#Data=&lt;string><a id="SerialReceivedData"></a>| whenever &lt;string> is received via hardware serial|
|SSerialReceived#Data=&lt;string>| whenever &lt;string> is received via software serial|
|IrReceived#Data=801<a id="IrReceivedData"></a>| whenever an IR signal for a RC5 remote control button 1 is received|
|IrReceived#Data=0x00FF9867|whenever an IR signal with hex code 0x00FF9867 is received|
|RfReceived#RfKey=4<a id="RfReceivedRfKey"></a>| whenever the [RF Bridge](devices/Sonoff-RF-Bridge-433) receives a recognized RfKey 4 signal
|RfReceived#Data=0xE8329E<a id="RfReceivedData"></a>|whenever an RF signal with hex code 0xE8329E is received|

### Rule Command
A rule command can be any command listed in the [Commands list](Commands). The command's `<parameter>` can be replaced with  `%value%` which will use the value of the trigger. 

`ON Switch1#State DO Power %value% ENDON`

To accomplish a rule with one trigger but several commands, you need to use `Backlog`:

`ON <trigger> DO Backlog <command1>; <command2>; <command3> ENDON`

**Appending new rule onto an existing rule set**  
Use the `+` character to append a new rule to the rule set. For example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing Rule1:  `ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Mem2 %time% ENDON`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule to append:  `ON Button1#state DO POWER TOGGLE ENDON`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command:         `Rule1 + ON button1#state DO POWER TOGGLE ENDON`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resulting in 
```console
Rule1 ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Mem2 %time% ENDON ON Button1#state DO POWER TOGGLE ENDON
```

You can duplicate the same trigger on many lines. 

```console
Rule
  on power2#state=1 do power1 1 endon
  on power2#state=1 do RuleTimer1 100 endon
```

### Rule Variables

There are ten available variables (double precision reals) in Tasmota, `Var1..Var5` and `Mem1..Mem5`. All `Var` will be empty strings when the program starts. The value of all `Mem` persists after a reboot. They provide a means to store the trigger `%value%` to be used in any rule.    

The value of a `Var<x>` and `Mem<x>` can be:  
- any number
- any text
- %var1% to %var5%
- %mem1% to %mem5% 
- %time%
- %timestamp%
- %uptime%
- %sunrise%
- %sunset%
- %utctime%
- %topic%

To set the value for `Var<x>` and `Mem<x>` use the command  
- `Var<x> <value>`
- `Mem<x> <value>`

The `<value>` can also be the value of the trigger of the rule.  
- Set Var2 to the temperature of the AM2301 sensor - `ON AM2301#Temperature DO Var2 %value% ENDON`
- Set Var4 to Var2's value - `ON Event#temp DO Var4 %Var2% ENDON`
- Set Mem2 to the current time (minutes elapsed since midnight) - `ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Mem2 %time% ENDON`
- After a Wi-Fi reconnect event, publish a payload containing timestamps of when Wi-Fi was disconnected in *From:* and when Wi-Fi re-connected in *To:* to `stat/topic/BLACKOUT`.
  ```console
  Rule1
    ON wifi#disconnected DO Var1 %timestamp% ENDON
    ON wifi#connected DO Var2 %timestamp% ENDON
    ON mqtt#connected DO Publish stat/topic/BLACKOUT {"From":"%Var1%","To":"%Var2%"} ENDON
  ```

### Clear a rule

To [clear / delete](Commands#rule) a rule you need to set it with one quote:

```console
Rule1 "
```


## Conditional Rules

!> **This feature is not included in precompiled binaries.**    
To use it you must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
```
#define USE_EXPRESSION         // Add support for expression evaluation in rules (+3k2 code, +64 bytes mem)  
#define SUPPORT_IF_STATEMENT   // Add support for IF statement in rules (+4k2 code, -332 bytes mem)  
```
----

### Major features  
- Support IF, ELSEIF, ELSE  
- Support for `<comparison>` and `<logical expression>` as condition  
- Support for executing multiple commands  
- Support for nested IF statements  
- Available free RAM is the only limit for logical operators, parenthesis, and nested IF statements.  

### Syntax  
`<if-statement>`  
- `IF (<logical-expression>) <statement-list> {ELSEIF (<logical-expression>) <statement-list>} [ELSE <statement-list>] ENDIF`  

`<logical-expression>`  
- `<comparison-expression>`  
- `(` `<comparison-expression>` | `<logical-expression>` `)` {{`AND` | `OR`} `<logical-expression>`}  
- `(` `<logical-expression>` `)` {`AND` | `OR`} `<logical expression>`}  

`<comparison-expression>`  
- `<expression>` {`=` \| `<` \| `>` \| `|` \| `==` \| `<=` \| `>=` \| `!=`} `<expression>`  

`<statement-list>`  
- `<statement>` {`;` `<statement>`}  

`<statement>`  
- {`<Tasmota-command>` | `<if-statement>`}  

### In English
IF statement supports 3 formats:  
- `IF (<logical-expression>) <statement-list> ENDIF`  
- `IF (<logical-expression>) <statement-list> ELSE <statement-list> ENDIF`  
- `IF (<logical-expression>) <statement-list> [ELSEIF (<logical-expression>) <statement-list> ] ELSE <statement-list> ENDIF`  

The outermost `<if-statement>` cannot be chained with other Tasmota commands in a `Backlog `. For example, `Backlog Power1 0; IF var1==1 Power1 1 ENDIF`, is **NOT** permitted. Commands chained with `<if-statement>` are allowed in a `<statement-list>`. For example, `IF ENERGY#Current>10 Power1 0; IF var1==1 Power1 1 ENDIF ENDIF`, **is** permitted.  

`<logical-expression>`  
Examples:  
- `VAR1>=10`  
- Multiple comparison expressions with logical operator `AND` or `OR` between them. `AND` has higher priority than `OR`. For example:  
`UPTIME>100 AND MEM1==1 OR MEM2==1`  
Parenthesis can be used to change the priority of logical expression. For example:  
`UPTIME>100 AND (MEM1==1 OR MEM2==1)`  
- The following variables can be used in `<condition>`:  

  Symbol|Description
  -|-
  VAR&lt;x>|variable (&lt;x> = `1..MAX_RULE_VARS`, e.g., `VAR2`)
  MEM&lt;x>|persistent variable (&lt;x> = `1..MAX_RULE_MEMS`, e.g., `MEM3`)
  TIME|minutes past midnight
  UPTIME|uptime minutes
  UTCTIME|UTC time, UNIX timestamp, seconds since 01/01/1970
  LOCALTIME|local time, UNIX timestamp
  SUNRISE|current sunrise time (minutes past midnight)
  SUNSET|current sunset time (minutes past midnight)

`<statement-list>`  
- A Tasmota command (e.g.,`LedPower on`)  
- Another IF statement (`IF ... ENDIF`)  
- Multiple Tasmota commands or IF statements separated by `;`. For example:  
  `Power1 off; LedPower on; IF (Mem1==0) Var1 Var1+1; Mem1 1 ENDIF; Delay 10; Power1 on`  
  `Backlog` is implied and is not required (saves rule set buffer space).  
  
  But not like this:
   `Power1 off; LedPower on; IF (Mem1==0) Var1 Var1+1; Mem1 1 ENDIF; Delay 10; Power1 on`

   You should split it in two lines like:
   `on power2#state=1 do Power1 off; LedPower on; endon`
   `on power2#state=1 do IF (Mem1==0) Var1 Var1+1; Mem1 1 ENDIF; Delay 10; Power1 on endon`

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Rule used to control pressure cooker with a Sonoff S31. Once it is finished cooking, shut off the power immediately.  
```
Rule1
 on system#boot do var1 0 endon
 on energy#power>100 do if (var1!=1) ruletimer1 0;var1 1 endif endon
 on tele-energy#power<50 do if (var1==1) var1 2;ruletimer1 600 endif endon
 on rules#timer=1 do backlog var1 0;power off endon  
```

## Expressions in Rules

!> **This feature is not included in precompiled binaries.**    

To use it you must [compile your build](Compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
```
#define USE_EXPRESSION         // Add support for expression evaluation in rules (+3k2 code, +64 bytes mem)  
#define SUPPORT_IF_STATEMENT   // Add support for IF statement in rules (+4k2 code, -332 bytes mem)  
```
----

Beginning with Tasmota version 6.4.1.14, an optional feature for using mathematical expressions in rules was introduced. 

### Supported Commands
Once the feature is enabled, the use of expressions is supported in the following commands:
* Var
* Mem
* RuleTimer
* [If conditional statement](#conditional-rules) (requires `#define SUPPORT_IF_STATEMENT`)

### Syntax
Expressions can use of the following operators. They are listed by the order of operations priority, from higher to lower.
* `(  )` (parentheses are used to explicitly control the order of operations)
* `^` (power)
* `%` (modulo, division by zero returns modulo "0")
* `*` and `/`  (multiplication and division; division by zero returns "0")
* `+` and `-`  (addition and subtraction)

> [!EXAMPLE]
>* `1+2*2`   results in 5.0 as the multiplication is done first due to its higher priority
* `(1+2)*2`   results in 6.0

In addition to numeric constants, the following symbolic values can be used:  

Symbol|Description
-|-
VAR&lt;x>|variable (&lt;x> = `1..MAX_RULE_VARS`, e.g., `VAR2`)
MEM&lt;x>|persistent variable (&lt;x> = `1..MAX_RULE_MEMS`, e.g., `MEM3`)
TIME|minutes past midnight
UPTIME|uptime minutes
UTCTIME|UTC time, UNIX timestamp, seconds since 01/01/1970
LOCALTIME|local time, UNIX timestamp
SUNRISE|current sunrise time (minutes past midnight)
SUNSET|current sunset time (minutes past midnight)

> [!EXAMPLE]
> `Mem1=((0.5*Var1)+10)*0.7`

To use expressions in the `Var`, `Mem` and `RuleTimer` commands, an equal sign (`=`) character has to be used after the command. If not, the traditional syntax interpretation is used.  

Statement|Var1 Result
-|-
`Var1=42`|42
`Var1 1+1`|"1+1" (the literal string)
`Var1=1+1`|2
`Var1=sunset-sunrise`|duration of daylight in minutes
