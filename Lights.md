?> ðŸ’¡ You know what lights do.... Right?

Lights come in various shapes (bulb, strips, ceiling lights, ...) but in Tasmota they are separated in 3 categories:
 - Channel Controlled LEDs
 - Addressable LEDs
 - Status LEDs 

## Lights in WebUI

<img style="float:right;height:120px" alt="Tasmota_on-off" src="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/_media/light_UI_5channel.png">

Tasmotas webUI displays **Brightness**, **CT**, **White**, **Color Picker**, **Color Saturation** or **PWM** level sliders depending on the light component, the number of PWM channels configured and SetOptions used.

See [**light commands**](Commands#light) for how to control lights.

## Channel Controlled Lights

### Switched Lights aka Relays

<img style="float:right;" width="180" alt="Tasmota_on-off" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555057-8d3e8f80-2a27-11ea-8fc5-4ecaed755bd5.png">

Switched or On/Off lights are controlled through `Relay` GPIOs.

If you define multiple relays, they are controlled with `Power<x>` starting at `x=1`.

**Alexa**: you can use Wemo emulation, your device will appear as a switch. You can change it to a light in the Alexa app.

**Alexa**: if you have one or multiple relays, you can use Philips Hue emulation. All devices will appear as On/Off lights, and named accordingly to `FriendlyName`. Note: if you have only Echo Spot 2nd generation, your light will have a dummy dimmer.

### 2 Channels - CCT Light

<img style="float:right;z-index:300;width:180px" alt="CCT" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555483-3471f580-2a2d-11ea-8eff-8a76e3555ef5.png">

2 channels lights are white lights with correlated color temperature (CCT) controls from Cold White (CT=153) to Warm White (CT=500).

**Alexa**: you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as White light with Color Temperature. Control through the Alexa app is limited to the `CT` range `199..383`.

|Configuration|(see below)|
|---|---|
|Commands|`Power`, `Dimmer`, `Color`, `White`, `CT`|

### 3 Channels - RGB Lights

<img style="float:right;z-index:300;width:180px" alt="RGB" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555478-11474600-2a2d-11ea-88e5-94a8eac3560a.png">

3 channel lights are RGB color lights. You can set color either via RGB or HSB (_not HSL_). Alexa support also allows XY color, but that is not supported through commands.

**Alexa**: you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as Color light.

|Configuration|(see below)|
|---|---|
|Commands|`Power`, `Dimmer`, `Color`, `HSBColor`|

### 4 Channels - RGBW Lights

<img style="float:right;width:180px" alt="RGB+W" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555488-48b5f280-2a2d-11ea-8173-1fd45cd5a1e3.png"><img style="float:right;width:180px" alt="RGBW-2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555832-65075e80-2a30-11ea-9ab6-66688081ef48.png">

4 channel lights are RGBW, i.e. RGB light and an additional White light. White can be either Warm White or Cold White depending on the manufacturer.

**Alexa**: you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as Color light and White light with CT control. The CT control is only present to force pure white instead of RGB white. Changin CT will have no effect.

**Warning**: some lights have limited power supply that do not allow all channels to be at full power at the same time. So be careful if you force all channels via `Color` or **RGB/White split**

### 5 Channels - RGBCCT Lights

<img style="float:right;" width="180" alt="Tasmota_5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555498-57040e80-2a2d-11ea-867c-a37d591930d2.png"><img style="float:right;" width="180" alt="Tasmota_5_2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71555844-8405f080-2a30-11ea-98c9-ea247cbedbc7.png">

5 channel lights are RGBCCT - an 3 channel RGB light and an additional 2 channel CCT light.

**Alexa**: you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as Color light and White light with CT control.

**Warning**: some lights have limited power supply that do not allow all channels to be at full power at the same time. So be careful if you force all channels via `Color` or **RGB/White split**

<br clear="right"/>

## Channel Controlled Lights Options

### Auto Power On - `SetOption20`

When enabling `SetOption20 1`, any change to `CT`, `Dimmer`, `HSBColor3`, `Color`, `Channel` results in a non-black color will auto-power-on the light if it was off.

Lights are always auto-powered-off when color is set to black or `Dimmer` set to `0`.

### PWM Channel Configuration

Lights controlled using up to 5 channels (red, green, blue, cold white, warm white). Channels are controlled using PWM or APDM.

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is the most common method of controlling LED lights. 

These lights are configured by assigning `PWM1(i)` through `PWM5(i)` components to their GPIOs; `PWM<x>i` means PWM is inverted. Depending on the number of used PWMs Tasmota will recognize the light as

|Channels|PWM1|PWM2|PWM3|PWM4|PWM5|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Brightness|||||
|2|Cold White|Warm White||||
|3|Red|Green|Blue||
|4|Red|Green|Blue|White||
|5|Red|Green|Blue|Cold White|Warm White|

### Gamma Correction - `LedTable`

Human eye perception of brightness is non linear, bringing back linearity needs a trick called **[Gamma Correction](https://learn.adafruit.com/led-tricks-gamma-correction)**.

Gamma Correction is enabled by default in Tasmota (`LedTable 1`).

Some lights have hardware gamma correction (f.e. Sonoff B1)., in which case software gamma correction should be disabled with `LedTable 0`.

>[!TIP] **How do I know if I have hardware gamma correction?**
>If you find your light very dark even with `Dimmer 40`, then you have probably hardware gamma correction. Solution: `LedTable 0`.

!> Internally Tasmota uses 10 bits resolution PWM to get smoother levels at low brightness. 

Here is the curve used (orange=ideal, blue=tasmota): <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49731213/71531106-798f0e00-28ed-11ea-8916-9ce2e9b98e27.png" width="360">

### White Blend Mode

White Blend Mode is used for 4 channel (RGBW) and 5 channel (RGBCCT) lights. It is enabled by setting the last PWM channel to zero (e.g., [`RGBWWTable 255,255,255,<n>,0`](Commands#rgbwwtable)for a 4 channel light) to lower the white channel intensity.

Generally white LEDs are brighter than RGB LEDs. If you want to keep the same brightness, you need to calibrate the white level. In this mode, any white component will be removed from RGB LEDs and sent to the white LEDs. This makes whites look much better.

Example: `Color 30508000` will be converted to `Color 0020503000` (0x30 is subtracted from R,G,B channels and added to the White channel)

To calibrate:

1. `Color FFFFFF00`
2. `RGBWWTable 255,255,255,255,255` - reset to RGB mode
3. `RGBWWTable 255,255,255,<n>,0` (begin the calibration process with `<n>` == 150)
4. If too bright, decrease `<n>`. If too dim, increase `<n>`
5. Go back to step 2 and iterate until satisfied with the color intensities.

Examples:
* Sonoff B1: `RGBWWTable 255,255,255,35,0`
* Teckin SB50: `RGBWWTable 255,255,255,80,0`

### PWM CT - `Module 48`

Some CCT lights use PWM1 for brightness and PWM2 for color temperature (instead of PWM1 for Cold White and PWM2 for Warm White).

For these lights, use `Module 48` aka Philips Xiaomi mode.

### RGB and White Split - `SetOption37 128`

By default RGBW and RGBCW can only operate in a one mode, either RGB or White. Enabling one mode disables the other.

Use `SetOption37 128` to split RGB and White into 2 indepedent lights. Note: if you are using Channel Remapping, just add `128` to the value of `SetOption37`.

### Channel Remapping - `SetOption37`

[remoteMarkdownUrl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tasmota/docs/master/SetOption37.md)

### MY92xx
MY92xx [family](http://www.my-semi.com/content/products/product_list.aspx?id=2) of drivers uses Adaptive Pulse Density Modulation. 

Configured in Tasmota by assigning `MY92x1 DI` and `MY92x DCKI` components to their GPIOs (some devices might have more than one  MY92xx controller)

Channel mapping for such devices is dependent on the controllers but is easily [remapped](SetOption37) using [`SetOption37`](Commands#setoption37).

### SM16716
SM16716 LEDs, sometimes mislabelled as WS2801.

Configured in Tasmota by assigning `SM16716 CLK`, `SM16716 DAT` and `SM16716 PWR` component to their GPIOs. 

Some SM16716 bulbs have BGR order and need [`SetOption37 54`](Commands#setoption57) to work properly.

## Addressable LEDs
Lights where each LED is individually controlled. In these lights it is possible to adjust each LEDs power, color and brightness, all just with the use of a single GPIO pin.

WebUI shows hue, saturation and brightness sliders and power toggle for these lights. Red and green color may be mixed up (observed for clone of [Wemos RGB shield](/peripherals/WS2812B-RGB-Shield) using Tasmota 8.1.0).

### WS2812
Any light using WS2811, WS2812b, WS2813 or SK6812 LEDs falls into this component. They're also commonly called Neopixel lights.

Configured in Tasmota by assigning `WS2812 (7)` component to its GPIO. 

For wiring, see instructions for [LED strip](/peripherals/WS2812B-and-WS2813) or [Wemos RGB shield](/peripherals/WS2812B-RGB-Shield).

## Status LEDs
Special subset of lights used to convey device status such as Wi-Fi and power. [Read more...](Status-LED)
