**This feature is included only in tasmota-sensors.bin** 

Otherwise you must [compile your build](compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:

```
#ifndef USE_IBEACON
#define USE_IBEACON          // Add support for bluetooth LE passive scan of ibeacon devices 
#endif
```

HM-17 and HM-16 are a Bluetooth BLE V4.1 module based on TI CC2640R2f chip. Manufactured by [Jinan Huamao](http://www.jnhuamao.cn/bluetooth.asp) 


## Configuration
Check whether your module is communicating properly over its TX/RX pins and that it has the required firmware (firmware V120 or V110). Only when you're sure everything is ok proceed with the configuration.

#### Wiring
| HM-16/17   | ESP8266 |
|---|---|
|GND   |GND   
|VCC   |3.3V
|TX   | GPIOx
|RX   | GPIOy

#### Tasmota Settings for iBeacon

In the _Configuration -> Configure Module_ page assign:
1. GPIOx to `iBeacon TX (168)`
2. GPIOy to `iBeacon RX (169)`

When first connected HM-16/17 is in peripheral mode. You have to change it to central mode using commands `Sensor52 1` and `Sensor52 2`.

If you have supported iBeacon Bluetooth devices in range, they will be discovered and will start to populate the webUI with data:
